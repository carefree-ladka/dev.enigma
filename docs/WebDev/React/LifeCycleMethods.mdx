title: React Lifecycle Methods
---

In React, lifecycle methods are hooks available in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle. These methods provide hooks for managing side effects, initializing data, and cleaning up resources. Here’s a summary of the key lifecycle methods:

## 1. Mounting:

### When a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

- **`constructor(props)`**: Initializes the component's state and binds methods. It's called before the component is mounted.

- **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState)`**: Invoked right before rendering, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It can return an object to update the state or `null` to do nothing.

- **`render()`**: The core method that returns the JSX to render. It should be a pure function, returning the same output for the same props and state.

- **`componentDidMount()`**: Invoked immediately after a component is mounted. Ideal for making network requests, initializing third-party libraries, or setting up subscriptions.

## 2. Updating:

### When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.

- **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState)`**: (Already mentioned under Mounting)

- **`shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`**: Determines if the component should re-render. By default, it returns `true`. It’s used for performance optimization.

- **`render()`**: (Already mentioned under Mounting)

- **`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`**: Invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM. It can capture information (e.g., scroll position) from the DOM before it is potentially changed.

- **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`**: Invoked immediately after updating occurs. It can be used for operations like network requests in response to prop or state changes. The `snapshot` argument comes from `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.

## 3. Unmounting:

### When a component is being removed from the DOM.

- **`componentWillUnmount()`**: Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. It’s used for cleanup tasks like invalidating timers, cancelling network requests, or cleaning up subscriptions.

## 4. Error Handling:

### When there’s an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

- **`static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`**: Invoked when an error is thrown during rendering. It allows you to update the state to display an error message.

- **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`**: Invoked when an error is thrown. It can be used to log error information or perform error handling.

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { data: null };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    // Update state based on props
    if (nextProps.someValue !== prevState.data) {
      return { data: nextProps.someValue };
    }
    return null;
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data or setup
    fetchData().then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Prevent re-render if data hasn't changed
    return nextState.data !== this.state.data;
  }

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Capture DOM info before the update
    return null;
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    // Handle updates
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cleanup
  }

  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.data}</div>;
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```
