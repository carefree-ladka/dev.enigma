title: Redux vs Redux-Saga
---

This document compares Redux Thunk and Redux-Saga, two popular middleware libraries for handling asynchronous actions in Redux applications.

## Comparison Table

| Feature                         | Redux Thunk                         | Redux-Saga                           |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Middleware for handling async logic | Middleware for handling side effects |
| **Async Handling**              | Handles async actions with thunk functions | Handles async logic with sagas and generators |
| **Complexity**                  | Lower complexity, easier setup      | Higher complexity, more setup        |
| **Boilerplate**                 | Less boilerplate                    | More boilerplate due to sagas and effects |
| **Learning Curve**              | Easier to learn, familiar with async functions | Steeper learning curve due to generator functions and sagas |
| **Error Handling**              | Can handle errors directly within thunks | Enhanced error handling with saga effects and retry logic |
| **Code Structure**              | Code is straightforward, thunks are simple functions | Sagas organize async logic in separate generator functions |
| **Testing**                     | Easier to test with mock dispatch and state | Sagas can be tested with helper functions and more control |
| **Integration**                 | Easily integrates with Redux, minimal setup | Requires setup with `redux-saga` middleware, more structured |
| **Middleware Capabilities**      | Basic middleware capabilities        | Advanced middleware capabilities, such as concurrent tasks and cancellation |
| **Use Cases**                   | Suitable for simpler async needs     | Better for complex async workflows, multiple concurrent tasks |
