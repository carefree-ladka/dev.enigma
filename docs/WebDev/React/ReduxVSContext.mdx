title: Redux vs Context API
---

In this document, we compare Redux and React's Context API to help you understand their differences and when to use each.

## Comparison Table

| Feature                       | Redux                                                           | Context API                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                   | State management library                                        | Lightweight state management                                                |
| **Complexity**                | Higher, requires setup and boilerplate                          | Lower, built into React                                                     |
| **Performance**               | Optimized for large state trees, uses memoization and selectors | Can suffer from performance issues with large state trees due to re-renders |
| **Middleware Support**        | Supports middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk, Redux Saga)             | No built-in middleware support                                              |
| **DevTools**                  | Rich DevTools extension with time-travel debugging              | No built-in DevTools support                                                |
| **Boilerplate**               | More boilerplate code                                           | Minimal boilerplate code                                                    |
| **State Management Approach** | Centralized store with reducers and actions                     | Decentralized, use of Providers and Consumers                               |
| **Ease of Use**               | Steeper learning curve                                          | Easier to get started with                                                  |
| **Integration**               | Integrates well with large applications                         | Better suited for simpler or smaller applications                           |
| **Use Cases**                 | Large scale applications with complex state logic               | Small to medium applications, less complex state management                 |
