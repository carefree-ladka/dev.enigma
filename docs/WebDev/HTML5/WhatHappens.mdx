# What Happens When You Type a URL in the Browser?

When you enter a URL in the browser and press Enter, multiple processes occur to fetch and render the webpage. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

## 1. URL Processing
- The browser checks the URL for validity.
- If no protocol (`http://` or `https://`) is specified, it defaults to one.

## 2. DNS Resolution
- The browser looks up the domain's IP address from its cache.
- If not found, it queries the OS's DNS resolver.
- If still unresolved, a DNS server (like Googleâ€™s `8.8.8.8`) is used to resolve the domain to an IP address.

## 3. Establishing a Connection
- A **TCP handshake** occurs: `SYN â†’ SYN-ACK â†’ ACK`.
- If HTTPS is used, a **TLS/SSL handshake** is performed for secure communication.

## 4. Sending HTTP Request
- The browser sends an HTTP request containing:
  - Request Method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
  - Headers (User-Agent, Cookies, Authorization, etc.)
  - Optional body data (for `POST`, `PUT` requests)

## 5. Server Processing
- The web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) receives the request.
- It may interact with a database or perform backend operations.
- The server generates an HTTP response (HTML, JSON, etc.).

## 6. Receiving HTTP Response
- The server responds with:
  - Status Code (`200 OK`, `301 Redirect`, `404 Not Found`, etc.)
  - Headers (Content-Type, Cache-Control, etc.)
  - Response Body (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, etc.)

## 7. Rendering the Page
- The browser parses the HTML document.
- Additional requests are made for linked resources (CSS, JS, images, etc.).
- CSS is applied, JavaScript is executed, and the DOM is built.
- The browser progressively renders the page.

## 8. Handling JavaScript & Additional Requests
- JavaScript may trigger further requests (AJAX, WebSockets, etc.).
- The page may update dynamically without a full reload.

## 9. Caching & Performance Optimization
- The browser caches static assets (CSS, images, scripts) for future use.
- CDNs optimize resource delivery.
- Compression (e.g., Gzip, Brotli) reduces payload size.
- Lazy loading and prefetching improve performance.

## 10. User Interaction
- The user interacts with the page (clicks, scrolls, inputs).
- JavaScript handles events dynamically.
- Single Page Applications (SPAs) may update content without full page reloads.

This is a high-level overview. Each step includes optimizations, security checks (DNS caching, HSTS, CSP), and browser-specific handling. ðŸš€
