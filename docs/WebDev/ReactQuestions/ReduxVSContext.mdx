title: Redux vs Context API
---


In this document, we compare Redux and React's Context API to help you understand their differences and when to use each.

## Comparison Table

| Feature                         | Redux                                | Context API                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | State management library             | Lightweight state management         |
| **Complexity**                  | Higher, requires setup and boilerplate | Lower, built into React              |
| **Performance**                 | Optimized for large state trees, uses memoization and selectors | Can suffer from performance issues with large state trees due to re-renders |
| **Middleware Support**          | Supports middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk, Redux Saga) | No built-in middleware support       |
| **DevTools**                    | Rich DevTools extension with time-travel debugging | No built-in DevTools support         |
| **Boilerplate**                 | More boilerplate code                | Minimal boilerplate code             |
| **State Management Approach**   | Centralized store with reducers and actions | Decentralized, use of Providers and Consumers |
| **Ease of Use**                 | Steeper learning curve               | Easier to get started with           |
| **Integration**                 | Integrates well with large applications | Better suited for simpler or smaller applications |
| **Use Cases**                   | Large scale applications with complex state logic | Small to medium applications, less complex state management |
