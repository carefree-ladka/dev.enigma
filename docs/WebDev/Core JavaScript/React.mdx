2. What is virtual DOM and what how it differs from the real DOM ?
3. What is JSX? Does the browser understand it ? (Hint: The browser doesn’t
understand the JSX. The browser simply makes use of createElement method
in React to convert the JSX into plain JavaScript object and that’ how the JS
Engine understands and compile it)
4. Explain the react lifecycle ad its order (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-
component.html#the-component-lifecycle)
5. Re-rendering in React how we can stop it. Hint (learn React.PureComponent,
ShouldComponentUpdate method and React.memo)
6. Higher Order Components in React with example
7. Render props
8. State and props with example
9. Explain setState method in class components and how it updates the state?
(Hint: setState takes a function which accepts the previousState and update
the current state)
10. Data binding in React
11. What is the use of keys in React?
12. Synthetic events
13. What are hooks in React?

15. React. Fragment and &lt;&gt; &lt;/&gt; let you render multiple components/elements in
React
16. How can you pass data from child to parent component and vice versa?
17. useMemo vs useCallback with example
18. useState vs useReducer
19. Context API vs Redux. When to use either one
20. Controlled vs uncontrolled forms in React
21. Explain different types of hooks eg) useState, useEffect, useMemo,
useCallback, useReducer, useRef etc.
22. What is useEffect and how it works?
23. Context API
24. What is Redux?
25. Explain the Redux flow
26. Explain the terms in Redux like action types, reducer, store and middlewares
27. What is Redux Thunk and what is its use?
28. Can we directly update the state in Redux? (Hint: we can’ t, we always make
a copy of the state and update it)
29. useSelector and useDispatch (Redux hooks)
30. What is tree Shaking?
31. What is React.lazy and React.suspense?
32. What can we do to optimize a React application? (Hint: we can use
optimization techniques such as React.PureComponents, useMemo,
useCallback, React.Memo, tree shaking, React.lazy and React.suspense)
33. Can we use setState inside of render() method? (Hint: we can’t , it’ll lead the
application to infinite loop)
34. Accessibility in React (https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#why-
accessibility)
