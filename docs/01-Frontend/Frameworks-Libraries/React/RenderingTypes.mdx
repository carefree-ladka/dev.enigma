title: Rendering Strategies Types
---

Rendering strategies in web development determine how and when components are rendered in a user interface. Here are the main types of rendering strategies:

## 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- **Description**: HTML is generated on the server for each request and sent to the client.
- **Advantages**:
  - Better for SEO as search engines can crawl the fully rendered content.
  - Faster initial load times, especially for users with slower devices or connections.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased server load since rendering happens for every request.
  - Can lead to longer wait times if server processing is slow.

## 2. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

- **Description**: JavaScript renders content on the client after loading the initial HTML.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduced server load since most of the rendering is done on the client side.
  - Faster navigation between pages as only data is fetched after the initial load.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slower initial load times since the browser must download and execute JavaScript before rendering.
  - SEO challenges as search engines might struggle to crawl JavaScript-heavy applications.

## 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)

- **Description**: HTML pages are pre-rendered at build time and served as static files.
- **Advantages**:
  - Extremely fast load times as content is served directly from a CDN.
  - Good for SEO since all content is available at build time.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Not suitable for dynamic content that changes frequently, unless re-deployment is performed.
  - Requires a build step to generate pages.

## 4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

- **Description**: Combines SSG and the ability to update static content after the site has been built.
- **Advantages**:
  - Can update content without requiring a full site rebuild.
  - Good for sites with mostly static content that occasionally updates.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complexity in implementation.
  - Some caching considerations are needed to ensure freshness.

## 5. Progressive Hydration

- **Description**: Renders static HTML on the server but enhances interactivity on the client in stages.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces time to interactive by progressively loading JavaScript.
  - Users can see content immediately, and interactivity can be added later.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex to implement.
  - Requires careful management of dependencies to ensure consistent state.

## 6. Hybrid Rendering

- **Description**: Combines multiple rendering strategies in a single application, e.g., using SSR for some pages and CSR for others.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexibility to choose the best rendering strategy per use case.
  - Can optimize performance and SEO based on specific needs.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased complexity in managing different rendering strategies.
  - Potential for inconsistencies in user experience if not well managed.
