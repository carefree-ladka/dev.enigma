title: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
---
The four pillars of OOP are fundamental concepts, and here's a recap of each:

## Encapsulation:

   - Wrapping data and methods into a single unit called a class.
It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent accidental interference.
For example, using getter and setter methods to control access to the internal state.

**Benefits:**
  - Data Hiding: Restrict access to internal object states.
  - Control: Allows controlled access through getter and setter methods.

```JavaScript
class Person {

  #name
  #age

  constructor(name, age) {
    this.#name = name;
    this.#age = age;
  }

  // Getter method
  get name() {
    return this.#name;
  }

  // Setter method
  set name(newName) {
    this.#name = newName;
  }
}

const p = new Person('John', 30);
console.log(p.name);  // John
p.name = 'Mike';      // Changing name via setter
console.log(p.name);  // Mike
```

## Abstraction:

   - Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features.
It allows for simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties an object should have.
You might have been asked how to implement abstract classes or interfaces to hide unnecessary implementation details.

**Benefits:**
  - Hides complexity.
  - Reduces programming errors by exposing only what is necessary.

```JavaScript
// Abstract class
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Abstract method (without implementation)
  makeSound() {
    throw "This method must be implemented by subclass";
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('Woof!');
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
dog.makeSound();  // Woof!
```

## Inheritance:

   - Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
You could have been asked about the difference between single inheritance and multiple inheritance, and how method overriding works in OOP.

```JavaScript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
dog.speak();  // Buddy barks.
```

## Polymorphism:

   - Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It also allows methods to have the same name but behave differently depending on the object calling them.
You might have been asked to explain method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass).

```JavaScript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak();  // Dog barks
```
**Example of Method Overloading (JavaScript doesnâ€™t support it directly):**

```JavaScript
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    if (arguments.length === 1) {
      return a + a;
    }
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.add(5));  // 10 (overloaded behavior)
console.log(calc.add(5, 3));  // 8
```

## Key Points

   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
   - **Composition over Inheritance**
   - **Avoid Tight Coupling**
   - **Favor Interfaces for Flexibility**
   - **Keep Classes Focused and Modular**

## Problem: Design a Parking Lot System
A parking lot has multiple parking spaces, each can either be free or occupied. We want to manage the parking spaces, allow parking a car, and retrieve a car when the parking lot is full or when a car is retrieved.

```JavaScript
// Car Class
class Car {
  constructor(licensePlate, model) {
    this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
    this.model = model;
  }
}

// ParkingSpot Class
class ParkingSpot {
  constructor(number) {
    this.number = number;
    this.isOccupied = false;
    this.car = null;
  }

  // Park a car in this spot
  parkCar(car) {
    if (this.isOccupied) {
      console.log(`Spot ${this.number} is already occupied.`);
      return false;
    }
    this.isOccupied = true;
    this.car = car;
    console.log(`Car with license plate ${car.licensePlate} is parked in spot ${this.number}.`);
    return true;
  }

  // Remove the car from this spot
  removeCar() {
    if (!this.isOccupied) {
      console.log(`Spot ${this.number} is empty.`);
      return false;
    }
    console.log(`Car with license plate ${this.car.licensePlate} is removed from spot ${this.number}.`);
    this.isOccupied = false;
    this.car = null;
    return true;
  }
}

// ParkingLot Class
class ParkingLot {
  constructor(totalSpots) {
    this.spots = [];
    this.availableSpots = totalSpots;
    // Create the parking spots
    for (let i = 0; i < totalSpots; i++) {
      this.spots.push(new ParkingSpot(i + 1)); // Create spots numbered 1 to totalSpots
    }
  }

  // Find an available parking spot
  findAvailableSpot() {
    for (let spot of this.spots) {
      if (!spot.isOccupied) {
        return spot;
      }
    }
    return null; // No available spots
  }

  // Park a car in the parking lot
  parkCar(car) {
    const spot = this.findAvailableSpot();
    if (spot) {
      return spot.parkCar(car);
    } else {
      console.log("Parking Lot is full!");
      return false;
    }
  }

  // Retrieve a car from the parking lot
  retrieveCar(licensePlate) {
    for (let spot of this.spots) {
      if (spot.isOccupied && spot.car.licensePlate === licensePlate) {
        return spot.removeCar();
      }
    }
    console.log(`Car with license plate ${licensePlate} not found.`);
    return false;
  }

  // Display parking lot status
  displayStatus() {
    console.log("Parking Lot Status:");
    for (let spot of this.spots) {
      console.log(`Spot ${spot.number}: ${spot.isOccupied ? 'Occupied' : 'Available'}`);
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage
const myParkingLot = new ParkingLot(3); // Create a parking lot with 3 spots

const car1 = new Car("ABC123", "Toyota");
const car2 = new Car("XYZ456", "Honda");
const car3 = new Car("LMN789", "Ford");

myParkingLot.parkCar(car1); // Park car1
myParkingLot.parkCar(car2); // Park car2
myParkingLot.parkCar(car3); // Park car3 (Parking Lot is full)

myParkingLot.displayStatus(); // Show current parking lot status

myParkingLot.retrieveCar("XYZ456"); // Retrieve car2
myParkingLot.displayStatus(); // Show updated parking lot status

/* 
Car with license plate ABC123 is parked in spot 1.
Car with license plate XYZ456 is parked in spot 2.
Car with license plate LMN789 is parked in spot 3.
Parking Lot Status:
Spot 1: Occupied
Spot 2: Occupied
Spot 3: Occupied
Parking Lot is full!
Car with license plate XYZ456 is removed from spot 2.
Parking Lot Status:
Spot 1: Occupied
Spot 2: Available
Spot 3: Occupied
*/
```

## Problem: Design a Library Management System
In this system:

   - We have Books that can be borrowed or returned by Members.
  - A Library manages the collection of books and the members who can borrow them.

```JavaScript
// Book Class
class Book {
  constructor(title, author) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.isAvailable = true; // A book can either be available or borrowed
  }

  borrow() {
    if (this.isAvailable) {
      this.isAvailable = false;
      console.log(`You have borrowed "${this.title}" by ${this.author}.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Sorry, "${this.title}" is currently unavailable.`);
    }
  }

  returnBook() {
    this.isAvailable = true;
    console.log(`You have returned "${this.title}" by ${this.author}.`);
  }
}

// Member Class
class Member {
  constructor(name, memberId) {
    this.name = name;
    this.memberId = memberId;
    this.borrowedBooks = [];
  }

  borrowBook(book) {
    if (book.isAvailable) {
      book.borrow();
      this.borrowedBooks.push(book);
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} cannot borrow "${book.title}". It is unavailable.`);
    }
  }

  returnBook(book) {
    if (this.borrowedBooks.includes(book)) {
      book.returnBook();
      this.borrowedBooks = this.borrowedBooks.filter(b => b !== book);
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} didn't borrow "${book.title}".`);
    }
  }

  viewBorrowedBooks() {
    if (this.borrowedBooks.length > 0) {
      console.log(`${this.name} has borrowed the following books:`);
      this.borrowedBooks.forEach(book => {
        console.log(`- "${book.title}" by ${book.author}`);
      });
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} has not borrowed any books.`);
    }
  }
}

// Library Class
class Library {
  constructor() {
    this.books = [];
    this.members = [];
  }

  addBook(book) {
    this.books.push(book);
    console.log(`"${book.title}" by ${book.author} added to the library.`);
  }

  addMember(member) {
    this.members.push(member);
    console.log(`New member ${member.name} added to the library.`);
  }

  listBooks() {
    if (this.books.length > 0) {
      console.log("Library Books:");
      this.books.forEach(book => {
        console.log(`- "${book.title}" by ${book.author} (${book.isAvailable ? 'Available' : 'Unavailable'})`);
      });
    } else {
      console.log("No books in the library.");
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage
const library = new Library();

const book1 = new Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald");
const book2 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell");
const book3 = new Book("Moby Dick", "Herman Melville");

library.addBook(book1);
library.addBook(book2);
library.addBook(book3);

const member1 = new Member("John Doe", 1);
const member2 = new Member("Jane Smith", 2);

library.addMember(member1);
library.addMember(member2);

library.listBooks(); // Show all books in the library

member1.borrowBook(book1); // John borrows "The Great Gatsby"
member2.borrowBook(book1); // Jane tries to borrow "The Great Gatsby" but it's unavailable
member1.viewBorrowedBooks(); // View John's borrowed books

member1.returnBook(book1); // John returns "The Great Gatsby"
member2.borrowBook(book1); // Now Jane can borrow "The Great Gatsby"
member2.viewBorrowedBooks(); // View Jane's borrowed books

library.listBooks(); // Show all books in the library again
/* 
"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald added to the library.
"1984" by George Orwell added to the library.
"Moby Dick" by Herman Melville added to the library.
New member John Doe added to the library.
New member Jane Smith added to the library.

## Problem: Design an Online Shopping Cart System
This system will involve:

   - Products that can be added to the cart.
   - Cart to manage the products and calculate the total price.
   - Customer to manage the customer information and checkout process

```JavaScript
// Product Class
class Product {
  constructor(id, name, price, stockQuantity) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
    this.stockQuantity = stockQuantity;
  }

  // Decrease the stock quantity when a product is added to the cart
  reduceStock(quantity) {
    if (quantity <= this.stockQuantity) {
      this.stockQuantity -= quantity;
      console.log(`${quantity} ${this.name}(s) added to the cart.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Not enough stock for ${this.name}. Only ${this.stockQuantity} left.`);
    }
  }

  // Restock the product when it is returned or replenished
  restock(quantity) {
    this.stockQuantity += quantity;
    console.log(`${quantity} ${this.name}(s) restocked.`);
  }
}

// Cart Class
class Cart {
  constructor() {
    this.products = [];
  }

  // Add a product to the cart
  addProduct(product, quantity) {
    product.reduceStock(quantity);
    this.products.push({ product, quantity });
  }

  // Remove a product from the cart
  removeProduct(productId) {
    const index = this.products.findIndex(item => item.product.id === productId);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.products.splice(index, 1);
      console.log(`Product with ID ${productId} removed from the cart.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Product with ID ${productId} not found in the cart.`);
    }
  }

  // Calculate the total price of the products in the cart
  calculateTotal() {
    let total = 0;
    this.products.forEach(item => {
      total += item.product.price * item.quantity;
    });
    return total;
  }

  // View the cart's contents
  viewCart() {
    if (this.products.length === 0) {
      console.log("Your cart is empty.");
    } else {
      console.log("Your cart contains:");
      this.products.forEach(item => {
        console.log(`${item.quantity} x ${item.product.name} - $${item.product.price} each`);
      });
    }
  }
}

// Customer Class
class Customer {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.cart = new Cart();
  }

  // Checkout the cart
  checkout() {
    const total = this.cart.calculateTotal();
    console.log(`Checkout for ${this.name}:`);
    console.log(`Total price: $${total}`);
    if (total > 0) {
      console.log("Thank you for shopping with us!");
    } else {
      console.log("Your cart is empty. Add some products before checking out.");
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage
const product1 = new Product(1, "Laptop", 1000, 10);
const product2 = new Product(2, "Phone", 500, 20);
const product3 = new Product(3, "Headphones", 100, 50);

const customer = new Customer("John Doe");

customer.cart.addProduct(product1, 2); // Add 2 laptops to the cart
customer.cart.addProduct(product2, 3); // Add 3 phones to the cart
customer.cart.addProduct(product3, 5); // Add 5 headphones to the cart

customer.cart.viewCart(); // View the cart

customer.checkout(); // Checkout and view the total

// Remove a product from the cart and checkout again
customer.cart.removeProduct(2); // Remove the phone from the cart
customer.cart.viewCart(); // View the updated cart

customer.checkout(); // Checkout again
/* 
2 Laptop(s) added to the cart.
3 Phone(s) added to the cart.
5 Headphones(s) added to the cart.
Your cart contains:
2 x Laptop - $1000 each
3 x Phone - $500 each
5 x Headphones - $100 each
Checkout for John Doe:
Total price: $4000
Thank you for shopping with us!
Product with ID 2 removed from the cart.
Your cart contains:
2 x Laptop - $1000 each
5 x Headphones - $100 each
Checkout for John Doe:
Total price: $2500
Thank you for shopping with us!
