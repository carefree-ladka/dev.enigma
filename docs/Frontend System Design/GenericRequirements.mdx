# Frontend System Design

## Functional Areas (What the System Does)

### **User Interface (UI)**
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Theme switching (light/dark mode)

### **User Authentication & Authorization**
- Login, Signup, Logout
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth, SSO, JWT-based authentication

### **Data Management**
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Data validation (client-side and server-side)

### **Search Functionality**
- Keyword-based search
- Faceted search (filter by categories)
- Autocomplete/typeahead suggestions

### **Filtering & Sorting**
- Filter data based on various criteria
- Sort data by columns (e.g., date, name, price)

### **Pagination & Infinite Scrolling**
- Paginated display of large datasets
- Infinite scroll for seamless data loading

### **Real-Time Updates**
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates
- Notifications and alerts

### **Notifications**
- In-app notifications
- Push notifications (browser or mobile)

### **File Management**
- File uploads and downloads
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Image compression and preview

### **Analytics & Reporting**
- Display charts, graphs, and tables
- Export data (CSV, PDF)

### **Third-Party Integrations**
- Payment gateways
- Social media integrations
- API integrations (e.g., Google Maps, Stripe)

### **Internationalization (i18n)**
- Support for multiple languages
- Currency and date format localization

### **Accessibility Features**
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast and font scaling

## Non-Functional Areas (How the System Performs)

### **Performance**
- Page load time (Time to First Byte, First Contentful Paint)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Efficient data fetching (debouncing, caching)

### **Scalability**
- Handle increasing user load and traffic
- Support horizontal scaling (adding more frontend instances)

### **Security**
- Secure data transmission (HTTPS, TLS)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

### **Reliability**
- High availability (uptime)
- Graceful degradation during failures
- Retry mechanisms for network failures

### **Maintainability**
- Modular and reusable code components
- Clear folder structure and naming conventions
- Documentation and inline comments

### **Testability**
- Unit testing for components
- Integration testing for data flow
- End-to-End (E2E) testing for user interactions

### **Usability**
- Intuitive navigation and UI design
- Minimal learning curve for new users
- Consistent user experience (UX)

### **Accessibility**
- Compliance with WCAG standards
- ARIA roles and attributes
- Keyboard and voice navigation

### **Device Compatibility**
- Responsive design across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### **Observability & Monitoring**
- Logging user interactions and errors
- Monitoring with tools like Sentry, LogRocket, or New Relic
- Track frontend performance metrics (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)

### **Extensibility**
- Ability to add new features without major refactoring
- Plugin-based architecture for third-party extensions

### **Deployment & CI/CD**
- Automated builds and deployments
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines
- Rollback mechanism for failed deployments
