# Microservices vs Monolith vs Serverless

## 1. Monolith Architecture

**Definition:** A monolithic application is a single, unified codebase that handles the entire frontend and backend.

### ✅ Pros
- Simple to develop and deploy.
- Easier to debug and test.
- Single codebase for consistency.
- No inter-service communication overhead.

### ❌ Cons
- Hard to scale individual components.
- Large codebase becomes difficult to manage.
- Deployment requires the entire system to be updated.
- Tech stack limitations (harder to mix multiple frameworks).

## 2. Microservices Architecture

**Definition:** A system divided into small, independent services communicating over APIs.

### ✅ Pros
- Independent scaling of services.
- Different teams can work on different services.
- Better fault isolation (one service failure doesn’t bring down the entire system).
- Can use different technologies per service.

### ❌ Cons
- More complex infrastructure.
- Higher latency due to inter-service communication.
- Managing API versioning and service discovery can be challenging.
- Requires DevOps expertise for orchestration.

## 3. Serverless Architecture

**Definition:** Functions run in a managed cloud environment, executing only when needed.

### ✅ Pros
- No server management.
- Auto-scaling and cost-efficient (pay only for execution time).
- Quick deployment and lower operational overhead.
- Suitable for event-driven architectures.

### ❌ Cons
- Cold start latency.
- Limited execution time per function (e.g., AWS Lambda 15 minutes max).
- Debugging and local development can be tricky.
- Vendor lock-in risk.

## 4. Microfrontends

**Definition:** Breaking down a frontend monolith into smaller, independently deployable frontend applications.

### ✅ Pros
- Allows multiple teams to develop different UI parts independently.
- Tech stack flexibility (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
- Incremental upgrades without affecting the whole app.
- Faster development cycles.

### ❌ Cons
- Increased complexity in managing different builds.
- Performance overhead due to multiple frameworks in a single app.
- Requires consistent design patterns across microfrontends.
- Cross-team coordination is essential.

**When to Choose What?**
- **Monolith** → Best for small projects, MVPs, and when simplicity is needed.
- **Microservices** → Suitable for large-scale applications with independent teams.
- **Serverless** → Ideal for event-driven, pay-per-use scenarios, and quick deployments.
- **Microfrontends** → Best for large frontend applications with multiple teams working independently.

## Conclusion
Each architecture has its strengths and weaknesses. The choice depends on scalability needs, team structure, deployment strategies, and cost considerations.
