# REST vs GraphQL

## **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

### **What It Is:**
A stateless architecture style for designing networked applications using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- URL endpoints represent resources.
- Communication via HTTP methods.
- Data format is typically JSON but can also include XML, plain text, etc.
- Stateless interactions; each request contains all the necessary information.

### **Advantages:**
1. Simple and widely adopted.
2. Leverages HTTP caching to improve performance.
3. Language-agnostic and framework-agnostic.
4. Suitable for simple CRUD operations.

### **Disadvantages:**
1. Over-fetching and under-fetching issues (clients often receive more or less data than needed).
2. Changes in API versions require maintaining multiple endpoints.
3. Limited flexibility in requesting specific data.

### **When to Use REST:**
- Applications with well-defined and stable resources (e.g., blog posts, user profiles).
- Systems requiring simple CRUD operations.
- When caching is critical for performance.

## **GraphQL**

### **What It Is:**
A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Single endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`).
- Clients define the structure of the response.
- Strongly typed schema (SDL - Schema Definition Language).
- Supports queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

### **Advantages:**
1. No over-fetching or under-fetching; clients get precisely what they request.
2. Flexible and efficient for evolving APIs.
3. Built-in introspection and documentation.
4. Reduces the number of requests for complex data structures.
5. Supports real-time updates via subscriptions.

### **Disadvantages:**
1. Complexity in setup and maintenance.
2. Overhead of query parsing and execution.
3. Challenges with caching due to dynamic queries.

### **When to Use GraphQL:**
- Applications with complex data relationships (e.g., social media, dashboards).
- When front-end developers need more control over the API.
- Rapidly evolving systems with frequent changes to data requirements.
- Scenarios requiring real-time data updates.

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Endpoint Structure**     | Multiple endpoints for resources             | Single endpoint (`/graphql`)                 |
| **Data Fetching**          | Over-fetching or under-fetching possible      | Fetch exactly what you need                  |
| **Real-Time Updates**      | Requires custom implementation (e.g., WebSockets) | Supported via subscriptions                  |
| **Caching**                | Simple with HTTP caching                     | More complex due to dynamic queries          |
| **Tooling**                | Mature tools like Postman                    | GraphQL playground, Apollo DevTools          |
| **Ease of Setup**          | Easier and faster                            | More complex, requires schema design         |
| **Use Cases**              | CRUD-heavy applications                      | Complex, flexible, or real-time applications |

## **When to Use Which?**

### Use **REST** When:
- Your API involves simple CRUD operations.
- Performance can be improved with HTTP caching.
- The system is already using REST and doesn't require advanced features.
- You need quick implementation with minimal complexity.

### Use **GraphQL** When:
- You want precise control over the data fetched.
- Your application has complex or nested data relationships.
- There are frequent changes to the front-end's data requirements.
- Real-time features like live updates or subscriptions are needed.

---

## **REST and GraphQL in the Same System**
It is possible to use both REST and GraphQL in the same system:
- Use REST for public APIs where simplicity and performance matter.
- Use GraphQL for internal APIs or client-facing systems requiring flexibility and customizability.
