# API Communication & Data Fetching

## 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)

### **Theory**

REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. It follows a stateless, client-server model where each request contains all necessary information.

### **Use Cases**

‚úÖ Simple, well-structured APIs for CRUD operations.  
‚úÖ Public APIs and microservices.  
‚úÖ Scalable systems with caching mechanisms.

### **Limitations**

‚ùå Over-fetching or under-fetching of data.  
‚ùå Multiple round trips needed for complex data queries.

## 2. GraphQL

### **Theory**

GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to request only the data they need. Unlike REST, which relies on multiple endpoints, GraphQL operates on a **single endpoint** with flexible queries.

### **How It Works?**

- Clients specify what data they need in a structured query.
- The server responds with only the requested data.

### **Use Cases**

‚úÖ Optimized data fetching (avoids over-fetching & under-fetching).  
‚úÖ Suitable for complex relationships (e.g., social media platforms).  
‚úÖ Ideal for mobile applications with limited bandwidth.

### **Limitations**

‚ùå Requires additional setup (GraphQL server, schema).  
‚ùå Caching is more complex than REST.

## 3. API Caching

### **Theory**

Caching stores frequently requested data to **reduce load times** and improve performance. It can be applied at different levels (client-side, server-side, or CDN).

### **Types of Caching**

- **Client-side caching:** Uses browser storage (LocalStorage, IndexedDB, etc.).
- **Server-side caching:** Stores responses in memory (Redis, Memcached).
- **CDN caching:** Stores static resources closer to users.

### **Use Cases**

‚úÖ Improving API performance and reducing server load.  
‚úÖ Optimizing repeated queries (e.g., user profile data, product listings).  
‚úÖ Reducing network latency.

### **Limitations**

‚ùå Stale data if caching is not invalidated properly.  
‚ùå Complexity in maintaining consistency.

---

## 4. WebSockets

### **Theory**

WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex communication channel over TCP, allowing real-time data exchange between the client and server.

### **How It Works?**

1. The client establishes a WebSocket connection.
2. Both client and server can send and receive messages at any time.
3. The connection remains open until explicitly closed.

### **Use Cases**

‚úÖ Real-time chat applications.  
‚úÖ Live notifications and stock price updates.  
‚úÖ Multiplayer gaming, collaborative tools (Google Docs-style editing).

### **Limitations**

‚ùå Not suitable for one-time requests.  
‚ùå Requires maintaining open connections, which increases server load.

## 5. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

### **Theory**

gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic framework that enables communication between services using **protocol buffers (protobufs)** instead of JSON.

### **How It Works?**

- Uses HTTP/2 for faster, multiplexed connections.
- Defines service methods using `.proto` files.
- Generates client and server code automatically.

### **Use Cases**

‚úÖ Microservices communication.  
‚úÖ High-performance, low-latency APIs.  
‚úÖ Streaming data and real-time messaging.

### **Limitations**

‚ùå Not human-readable (uses binary format instead of JSON).  
‚ùå Requires gRPC clients for non-browser environments.
