# Frontend System Design Template

## 1. Requirements Gathering

Start by asking clarifying questions to fully understand the requirements. Separate them into functional and non-functional requirements.

### a. Functional Requirements:

- What are the key features?
- User authentication (e.g., login, signup)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Search functionality
- Notifications
- Real-time updates (if applicable)

### b. Non-Functional Requirements:

- Performance: How fast should the system respond?
- Scalability: How many users are expected?
- Security: Are there sensitive data and compliance requirements?
- Accessibility: Should the app be WCAG-compliant?
- Device Compatibility: Should it work on both desktop and mobile?

## 2. System Overview

Provide a high-level overview of the system and its core components.

Example Diagram:

```
User -> Browser (Frontend) -> API Gateway -> Backend (Server/DB) -> External Services
```

Explain the data flow:

- User interactions occur in the frontend
- The frontend communicates with the backend via APIs
- Backend handles business logic and interacts with databases or external services

## 3. Frontend Architecture

Outline the architecture you would use for the frontend.

### a. Tech Stack:

- Framework: React, Vue.js, or Angular for building the UI
- State Management: Redux, Zustand, or Context API for managing global state
- Routing: React Router or Vue Router for handling navigation
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components for styling

### b. Component Design:

Use a component-based architecture for better maintainability and reusability.

Example structure:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   ├── Footer.js
│   └── Button.js
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.js
│   └── Dashboard.js
└── App.js
```

## 4. Key Design Considerations

### a. Scalability:

- Lazy Loading: Load components only when needed to improve initial load time
- Code Splitting: Split the code into chunks to reduce bundle size
- CDN: Serve static assets (images, JS, CSS) through a Content Delivery Network

### b. Performance:

- Debouncing & Throttling: Optimize event handlers like search or scroll events
- Caching: Use browser caching and service workers for offline support
- Image Optimization: Use responsive images and lazy load them

### c. Maintainability:

- Modular Code: Write small, reusable components
- Linting & Formatting: Use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality
- Testing: Implement unit tests (Jest) and integration tests (Cypress)

### d. Security:

- Authentication: Implement OAuth, JWT, or SSO for user authentication
- Data Encryption: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Prevent XSS attacks by defining a strict CSP

### e. Accessibility (A11Y):

- Ensure all components are keyboard-accessible
- Provide ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
- Use sufficient color contrast and scalable fonts

### f. Data Loading & Pagination:

- Pagination strategies:
  - Offset-based pagination: Using page number and size
  - Cursor-based pagination: Using unique identifiers
  - Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Infinite scroll implementation:
  - Intersection Observer for trigger points
  - Loading states and thresholds
  - Memory management and cleanup

### g. Responsive Design:

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- Fluid layouts and flexible grids
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Responsive images and media

## 5. Frontend-Backend Communication

### Communication Protocols:

- REST API:
  - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Status codes and error handling
  - Resource-based routing
- GraphQL:
  - Query and Mutation operations
  - Schema definition
  - Type system and resolvers

- Real-time Communication:
  - WebSockets for bi-directional communication
  - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for server push
  - Long polling as fallback
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:
  - Multiplexing
  - Server push
  - Header compression

### API Implementation:

```jsx
// REST Example
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  return response.json();
};

// GraphQL Example
const query = `
  query GetData {
    users {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

// WebSocket Example
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com');
ws.onmessage = event => {
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};

// SSE Example
const eventsource = new EventSource('/api/events');
eventsource.onmessage = event => {
  console.log('Event:', event.data);
};
```

### API Design:

- REST or GraphQL

### Error Handling:

- Gracefully handle errors and display user-friendly messages
- Implement retry logic for transient network failures

### Data Fetching:

- Use fetch, Axios, or GraphQL queries
- Implement caching strategies (e.g., SWR, React Query)

## 6. State Management

Explain how the application state will be managed.

- Global State: Redux, Zustand, or Context API for managing global state
- Local State: Use React's useState or useReducer for component-specific state
- Asynchronous State: Handle async operations with libraries like React Query

## 7. Routing

Discuss how you will handle routing in the frontend.

- Use client-side routing for a single-page application (SPA)
- Implement lazy loading for route-based code splitting

Example route structure:

```jsx
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

## 8. Error Handling and Logging

Discuss how errors will be handled and logged.

- UI Error Handling: Display error messages using toast notifications or modals
- Global Error Boundary: Use React's ErrorBoundary to catch runtime errors
- Logging: Integrate with services like Sentry or LogRocket for error monitoring

## 9. Testing Strategy

Explain how you will ensure the frontend is reliable and bug-free.

- Unit Testing: Test individual components using Jest
- Integration Testing: Test the interaction between components using Cypress or Playwright
- End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Simulate user interactions to test the entire flow

## 10. Performance Monitoring

Discuss how you will monitor and improve the performance of the frontend.

### Tools:

Use Lighthouse, Web Vitals, or New Relic for performance monitoring

### Metrics to Track:

- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## 11. Extensibility and Future Enhancements

Conclude by discussing how the system can be extended in the future.

- Modular Design: Each feature can be developed and deployed independently
- Feature Toggles: Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Internationalization (i18n): Add support for multiple languages and currencies
