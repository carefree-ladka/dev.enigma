# Web Communication Protocols

## 1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
### **Theory**
HTTP is a **request-response** protocol where the client (browser) sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data. It is **stateless**, meaning each request is independent.

### **Use Cases**
✅ Static content delivery (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos).  
✅ RESTful APIs for client-server communication.  
✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  

### **Limitations**
❌ No real-time updates without polling or websockets.  
❌ Each request establishes a new connection, adding latency.

## 2. WebSockets
### **Theory**
WebSockets provide a **persistent, full-duplex** communication channel between the client and server over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP, WebSockets enable **real-time bidirectional** communication.

### **Use Cases**
✅ Chat applications (Slack, WhatsApp, Messenger).  
✅ Live notifications and real-time stock market updates.  
✅ Multiplayer gaming (instant interactions between players).  
✅ Collaborative tools (Google Docs-style live editing).  
✅ Video/audio streaming.  

### **Limitations**
❌ Not ideal for one-time or infrequent updates.  
❌ Requires more server resources due to persistent connections.  
❌ WebSocket connections may be blocked by certain firewalls or proxies.

## 3. HTTP Polling
### **Theory**
HTTP Polling is a technique where the client **periodically sends requests** to the server to check for updates. The server responds with the latest data (if any).

### **Use Cases**
✅ When WebSockets are not supported but real-time updates are needed.  
✅ Less frequent updates (e.g., refreshing a dashboard every 30 seconds).  
✅ Environments where long-lived connections are not feasible.  

### **Limitations**
❌ Higher server load due to frequent requests.  
❌ Increased latency since updates arrive only on the next request cycle.  
❌ Inefficient for high-frequency real-time data.

## 4. SSE (Server-Sent Events)
### **Theory**
SSE is a **one-way communication** method where the server pushes updates to the client over an HTTP connection. The connection remains open, and the server sends data when available.

### **Use Cases**
✅ Live feeds (news updates, sports scores).  
✅ Stock market updates where only the client needs to receive data.  
✅ Real-time notifications that don’t require two-way communication.  
✅ Realtime analytics dashboards.  

### **Limitations**
❌ Only supports server-to-client communication (not bidirectional).  
❌ Limited browser support (mainly works well in modern browsers).  
❌ Less scalable compared to WebSockets for very high concurrency.

## **Comparison Table**

| Feature         | HTTP  | WebSockets | HTTP Polling | SSE |
|---------------|------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Real-time** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Delayed | ✅ Yes (one-way) |
| **Bidirectional** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Efficiency** | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ High | ❌ Low (high overhead) | ✅ High |
| **Use Case** | Static content, APIs | Chat, notifications, games | Periodic updates | Live updates |
| **Latency** | High | Low | Medium-High | Low |
| **Scalability** | High | Medium | Low | Medium |

## **When to Use What?**
- **Use HTTP** for standard web page requests and API calls.
- **Use WebSockets** for real-time, bidirectional communication like chat apps and multiplayer games.
- **Use HTTP Polling** when WebSockets are not an option and occasional updates are needed.
- **Use SSE** for real-time server-to-client updates where bidirectional communication is unnecessary.
