# Number of Islands Pattern

The **Number of Islands** problem is a classic grid-based problem that involves finding the number of distinct islands in a 2D grid. An island is formed by connected groups of `1`s (land), and they are surrounded by `0`s (water). The land cells can be connected either vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.

## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water). Your task is to count the number of islands. An island is a group of `1`s connected vertically or horizontally, and surrounded by water (`0`s).

## Graph Traversal Pattern

This problem uses a graph traversal pattern where you need to explore and mark connected components in a grid. This pattern can be applied to other problems such as finding the size of the largest connected component or counting distinct regions.

### Algorithm

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node.
   - Cells with value `1` are land and can be treated as connected if they are adjacent (up, down, left, right).

2. **DFS/BFS for Traversal:**
   - Use DFS or BFS to explore the entire component (all connected land cells) starting from a `1`. Once you visit a land cell, mark it as visited (by changing it to `0` or using a `visited` array).
   - For every unvisited land cell, initiate a new DFS/BFS traversal, and count it as a new island.

3. **Marking Visited:**
   - Once you visit a cell, mark it as visited to avoid counting the same island multiple times. This can be done by:
     - Modifying the grid in-place (changing `1` to `0` after visiting).
     - Using a `visited` array to track visited cells.

## DFS Approach

```Javascript
Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

```Javascript
function numIslands(grid) {
    if (!grid || grid.length === 0) return 0;

    let numIslands = 0;
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    // Helper function to perform DFS
    const dfs = (grid, r, c) => {
        // Base case: check bounds and if the current cell is water or already visited
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || grid[r][c] === '0') return;

        // Mark the cell as visited by setting it to '0'
        grid[r][c] = '0';

        // Explore the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right)
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c); // up
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c); // down
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1); // left
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1); // right
    };

    // Iterate through the entire grid
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === '1') {
                // Found an island, increment the count
                numIslands++;

                // Use DFS to mark all connected land as visited
                dfs(grid, r, c);
            }
        }
    }

    return numIslands;
}
```
