## Key Principles for Interviews

1. **There's no perfect solution** – Every choice has trade-offs
2. **Clarify requirements first** – Ask about scale, consistency needs, budget
3. **Start simple** – Begin with monolith/single DB, explain when to evolve
4. **Justify your choices** – Explain *why* you chose one approach over another
5. **Consider evolution** – How does the system scale as requirements change?
6. **Think about real examples** – Reference systems like Netflix, Amazon, Twitter

Remember: The goal isn't to memorize solutions, but to understand the trade-offs and make informed decisions based on specific requirements.
