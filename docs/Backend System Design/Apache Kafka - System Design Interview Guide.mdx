## What is Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a **distributed event streaming platform** designed for high-throughput, low-latency data streaming. Originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced, Kafka acts as a distributed commit log that can handle millions of events per second.

### Core Concepts

- **Event Streaming**: Continuous flow of data records (events) between systems
- **Distributed**: Runs as a cluster across multiple servers for fault tolerance
- **Persistent**: Events are stored on disk and replicated across brokers
- **Pub-Sub Model**: Publishers send messages to topics, consumers subscribe to topics
- **Immutable Log**: Events are append-only and immutable once written

### Key Characteristics

- **High Throughput**: Millions of messages per second
- **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond message delivery
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Add more brokers to handle increased load
- **Durability**: Messages persisted to disk with configurable retention
- **Fault Tolerance**: Data replicated across multiple brokers
- **Ordering Guarantees**: Messages ordered within partitions

---

## Why Use Kafka

### Traditional Messaging Problems

**Point-to-Point Systems**:

- Tight coupling between producers and consumers
- Difficult to add new consumers
- Single point of failure
- Limited scalability

**Traditional Message Queues**:

- Messages deleted after consumption
- Limited replay capability
- Difficulty handling high throughput
- Complex routing logic

### Kafka Solutions

1. **Decoupling**: Producers and consumers don't need to know about each other
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through partitioning
3. **Durability**: Messages stored for configurable time periods
4. **Replay**: Consumers can replay messages from any point
5. **Multi-Consumer**: Multiple consumer groups can read same data
6. **Ordering**: Maintains message order within partitions
7. **Fault Tolerance**: No single point of failure

### Business Benefits

- **Real-time Processing**: Enable real-time analytics and responses
- **System Integration**: Connect disparate systems seamlessly
- **Event Sourcing**: Build event-driven architectures
- **Data Pipeline**: Create reliable data pipelines
- **Microservices Communication**: Async communication between services

---

## Core Components

### 1. Topics

**Definition**: Named streams of records where events are published

```
Topic: "user-events"
├── Partition 0: [event1, event2, event3, ...]
├── Partition 1: [event4, event5, event6, ...]
└── Partition 2: [event7, event8, event9, ...]
```

**Characteristics**:

- Logical grouping of related events
- Split into multiple partitions for parallelism
- Immutable append-only logs
- Configurable retention period

### 2. Partitions

**Purpose**: Enable parallelism and scalability

**Key Features**:

- **Ordering**: Messages ordered within each partition
- **Parallelism**: Different partitions can be processed in parallel
- **Distribution**: Partitions distributed across brokers
- **Key-based Routing**: Messages with same key go to same partition

**Partition Assignment**:

```
Message Key → Hash Function → Partition Number
```

### 3. Brokers

**Definition**: Kafka servers that store and serve data

**Responsibilities**:

- Store partition data on disk
- Handle producer and consumer requests
- Replicate data to other brokers
- Manage partition leadership

**Cluster Configuration**:

```
Kafka Cluster
├── Broker 1 (Leader for Partition 0)
├── Broker 2 (Leader for Partition 1)
└── Broker 3 (Leader for Partition 2)
```

### 4. Producers

**Role**: Applications that publish events to Kafka topics

**Key Features**:

- **Batching**: Group multiple messages for efficiency
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Determine which partition to send messages
- **Acknowledgment Modes**: Configure delivery guarantees
- **Compression**: Reduce network overhead

**Producer Configurations**:

- `acks=0`: Fire and forget (fastest, least reliable)
- `acks=1`: Wait for leader acknowledgment
- `acks=all`: Wait for all replicas (slowest, most reliable)

### 5. Consumers

**Role**: Applications that read events from Kafka topics

**Consumer Groups**:

- Multiple consumers working together
- Each partition assigned to only one consumer in group
- Automatic rebalancing when consumers join/leave

**Offset Management**:

- Track position in each partition
- Enable replay from specific points
- Stored in special Kafka topic `__consumer_offsets`

### 6. ZooKeeper (Legacy) / KRaft (New)

**ZooKeeper (Legacy)**:

- Manages cluster metadata
- Handles leader election
- Stores configuration information
- Being phased out in newer versions

**KRaft (Kafka Raft)**:

- New consensus protocol
- Eliminates ZooKeeper dependency
- Simplifies deployment and operations
- Better scalability and performance

## Kafka Architecture

### Cluster Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Kafka Cluster                        │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐              │
│  │ Broker 1 │  │ Broker 2 │  │ Broker 3 │              │
│  │          │  │          │  │          │              │
│  │ Topic A  │  │ Topic A  │  │ Topic A  │              │
│  │   P0(L)  │  │   P1(L)  │  │   P0(F)  │              │
│  │   P1(F)  │  │   P0(F)  │  │   P1(F)  │              │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↑                                           ↓
┌──────────┐                               ┌──────────┐
│Producer 1│                               │Consumer 1│
│Producer 2│                               │Consumer 2│
└──────────┘                               └──────────┘
```

**Legend**: P0(L) = Partition 0 Leader, P0(F) = Partition 0 Follower

### Replication Strategy

**Leader-Follower Model**:

- Each partition has one leader and multiple followers
- Producers/consumers interact only with leaders
- Followers replicate data from leaders
- Automatic failover if leader fails

**In-Sync Replicas (ISR)**:

- Replicas that are caught up with leader
- Used for leader election
- Ensures data consistency

### Message Flow

1. **Producer** sends message to topic partition
2. **Leader broker** appends message to log
3. **Follower brokers** replicate the message
4. **Acknowledgment** sent back to producer
5. **Consumers** read messages from partitions
6. **Offset** updated after successful processing

## Role in Distributed Systems

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

**Traditional Request-Response**:

```
Service A → Direct Call → Service B → Direct Call → Service C
```

**Event-Driven with Kafka**:

```
Service A → Event → Kafka → Service B
                        ↓
                    Service C
```

**Benefits**:

- Loose coupling between services
- Asynchronous processing
- Better fault tolerance
- Easier to add new consumers

### 2. Data Pipeline

**ETL/ELT Processes**:

```
Data Sources → Kafka → Stream Processing → Data Stores
    ↓              ↓           ↓              ↓
  APIs         Topics     Kafka Streams    Databases
Databases                   Apache Flink   Data Lakes
Files                      Apache Storm    Warehouses
```

### 3. Microservices Communication

**Service Mesh with Kafka**:

- **Command Events**: Trigger actions in other services
- **Domain Events**: Notify about business state changes
- **Integration Events**: Share data between bounded contexts

### 4. CQRS and Event Sourcing

**Command Query Responsibility Segregation**:

- Commands → Kafka → Command Handlers
- Events → Kafka → Read Model Updates

**Event Sourcing**:

- Store events instead of current state
- Kafka as event store
- Replay events to rebuild state

## System Design Patterns

### 1. Saga Pattern

**Distributed Transactions**:

```
Order Service → Kafka → Payment Service
      ↓                        ↓
  OrderCreated              PaymentProcessed
      ↓                        ↓
Inventory Service ←  Kafka  ← Notification Service
```

### 2. Outbox Pattern

**Transactional Outbox**:

```
Application → Database Transaction → Outbox Table
                                         ↓
                                    CDC → Kafka
```

**Benefits**:

- Ensures message delivery
- Maintains data consistency
- Handles dual-write problem

### 3. Change Data Capture (CDC)

**Database Changes → Kafka**:

```
Database → Kafka Connect → Kafka → Downstream Systems
(Binlog)   (Debezium)      Topics   (Real-time views)
```

### 4. Stream Processing

**Real-time Analytics**:

```
Raw Events → Kafka → Stream Processor → Aggregated Events
                         ↓
                    Kafka Streams
                   Apache Flink
```
