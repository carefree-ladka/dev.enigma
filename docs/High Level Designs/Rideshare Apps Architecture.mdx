## 2. Location Service Architecture

### Real-Time Location Tracking
**Challenge**: Track millions of moving GPS coordinates with minimal latency

**Components**:
- **Location Ingestion**: Receive GPS updates every 4-30 seconds
- **Geospatial Indexing**: QuadTree/R-Tree for efficient spatial queries
- **Location Validation**: Filter GPS noise and validate accuracy
- **Real-time Broadcasting**: Push updates to relevant services

### GPS Data Flow
```
Driver App → Location Update → Location Service → Geospatial Index → Matching Service
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
- **Adaptive Polling**: Reduce GPS frequency when stationary
- **Dead Reckoning**: Predict location during network outages
- **Geofencing**: Trigger events when entering/exiting areas
- **Location Smoothing**: Filter GPS jitter and anomalies

## 3. Matching Engine Design

### Core Matching Problem
**Goal**: Find optimal driver for each ride request in `<3` seconds

### Matching Process Flow
```
1. Ride Request Received
   ├── Extract pickup location & preferences
   ├── Define search radius (start 0.5km, expand to 5km)
   └── Query geospatial index for nearby drivers

2. Driver Filtering
   ├── Filter by availability status
   ├── Filter by vehicle type compatibility
   ├── Filter by driver preferences (destination, ride types)
   └── Apply business rules (ratings, acceptance rate)

3. Multi-Factor Scoring
   ├── Distance to pickup (40% weight)
   ├── Driver rating (20% weight)
   ├── Acceptance rate (20% weight)
   ├── Vehicle match (10% weight)
   └── Historical performance (10% weight)

4. Driver Selection & Assignment
   ├── Rank drivers by composite score
   ├── Send request to top 3-5 drivers simultaneously
   ├── First acceptance wins
   └── Fallback to next driver if timeout/decline
```

### Advanced Matching Strategies

**Batching & Pooling**:
- Group nearby ride requests for shared rides
- Optimize routes for multiple passengers
- Balance individual convenience vs system efficiency

**Predictive Positioning**:
- Move idle drivers to high-demand areas
- Use ML models to predict demand hotspots
- Reduce average pickup times

**Supply-Demand Balancing**:
- Incentivize drivers to move to underserved areas
- Dynamic driver bonuses for repositioning
- Heat maps showing demand patterns

---

## 4. Dynamic Pricing System

### Surge Pricing Mechanism
**Purpose**: Balance supply and demand through price elasticity

### Surge Calculation Process
```
1. Zone-Based Analysis
   ├── Divide city into hexagonal zones
   ├── Monitor active ride requests per zone
   ├── Track available drivers per zone
   └── Calculate demand/supply ratios

2. Surge Multiplier Calculation
   ├── Baseline multiplier = 1.0x
   ├── High demand (>1.5x supply) = 1.2-2.0x surge
   ├── Extreme demand (>3.0x supply) = 2.0-5.0x surge
   └── Emergency/events = Manual surge caps

3. Temporal Smoothing
   ├── Prevent sudden surge spikes/drops
   ├── Gradual increase/decrease over 5-10 minutes
   ├── Historical patterns influence pricing
   └── Machine learning for demand prediction

4. User Communication
   ├── Display surge multiplier before booking
   ├── Estimated fare range with surge
   ├── Option to wait for lower surge
   └── Push notifications when surge decreases
```

### Pricing Strategy Considerations
- **Price Elasticity**: Higher prices reduce demand, attract drivers
- **Market Dynamics**: Competition with other platforms
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Government price caps in some regions
- **User Experience**: Balance profitability vs customer satisfaction
