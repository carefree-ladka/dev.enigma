# Social Media Timeline Design - HLD Architecture ðŸ“°

## Core Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Generate personalized timelines for billions of users in real-time while handling celebrity posts that can reach millions of followers instantly.

**Scale Requirements**:

- **Reads**: 100:1 read-to-write ratio (users scroll more than they post)
- **Latency**: `<200ms` timeline load time
- **Throughput**: Millions of timeline requests per second
- **Storage**: Billions of posts with complex relationships

---

## 1. Timeline Generation Strategies

### Three Core Approaches

#### 1.1 Pull Model (Fan-out on Read)

```
Timeline Request Flow:
User Request â†’ Timeline Service â†’ Query Following List â†’ Fetch Recent Posts â†’ Rank & Merge â†’ Return Timeline

Characteristics:
â”œâ”€â”€ Real-time content (always fresh)
â”œâ”€â”€ Low storage overhead
â”œâ”€â”€ High compute cost per read
â””â”€â”€ Slow response times (complex queries)

Best For:
â”œâ”€â”€ Celebrity accounts (millions of followers)
â”œâ”€â”€ Less active users
â”œâ”€â”€ Systems prioritizing storage efficiency
â””â”€â”€ Users following many inactive accounts
```

#### 1.2 Push Model (Fan-out on Write)

```
Post Creation Flow:
New Post â†’ Get Followers List â†’ Push to All Follower Timelines â†’ Store in Timeline Cache

Timeline Request Flow:
User Request â†’ Timeline Service â†’ Fetch Pre-computed Timeline â†’ Return Results

Characteristics:
â”œâ”€â”€ Ultra-fast reads (pre-computed)
â”œâ”€â”€ High storage cost (duplicate data)
â”œâ”€â”€ Expensive writes for popular users
â””â”€â”€ Potential stale data during high activity

Best For:
â”œâ”€â”€ Regular users (<10K followers)
â”œâ”€â”€ Active users who read frequently
â”œâ”€â”€ Real-time systems prioritizing read speed
â””â”€â”€ Mobile apps needing fast loading
```

#### 1.3 Hybrid Model (Mixed Strategy)

```
Decision Logic:
if (user.followers_count > CELEBRITY_THRESHOLD) {
    use PULL_MODEL
} else {
    use PUSH_MODEL
}

Timeline Assembly:
â”œâ”€â”€ Pull celebrity posts on-demand
â”œâ”€â”€ Merge with pre-computed timeline cache
â”œâ”€â”€ Apply personalization ranking
â””â”€â”€ Return unified timeline

Characteristics:
â”œâ”€â”€ Balanced performance and cost
â”œâ”€â”€ Complex implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ Optimal for mixed user bases
â””â”€â”€ Scalable across user segments
```

## 2. Celebrity Problem Deep Dive

### The Celebrity Challenge

**Problem**: When a celebrity with 50M followers posts, the fan-out on write approach would:

- Create 50M timeline entries instantly
- Overwhelm the write system
- Cause massive storage overhead
- Delay post visibility due to processing time

### Celebrity Handling Strategies

#### 2.1 Celebrity Detection

```
Celebrity Classification:
â”œâ”€â”€ Static Thresholds
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ >1M followers = Celebrity
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ >100K followers = Influencer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <100K followers = Regular user
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Verified accounts = Celebrity
â”œâ”€â”€ Dynamic Classification
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Follower growth rate
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Engagement velocity
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Post reach metrics
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Media mentions
â””â”€â”€ Manual Override
    â”œâ”€â”€ News organizations
    â”œâ”€â”€ Government accounts
    â”œâ”€â”€ Brand accounts
    â””â”€â”€ Emergency services
```

#### 2.2 Celebrity Timeline Architecture

```
Celebrity Post Flow:
1. Celebrity posts content
2. Store in Celebrity Content Service
3. Mark as "celebrity post" in metadata
4. Skip fan-out process initially
5. Index for real-time retrieval

User Timeline Request (with celebrity content):
1. Fetch pre-computed timeline (regular follows)
2. Query Celebrity Content Service for followed celebrities
3. Merge celebrity content with regular timeline
4. Apply ranking algorithm
5. Return unified timeline
```

#### 2.3 Celebrity Content Optimization

```
Multi-Tier Celebrity Handling:
â”œâ”€â”€ Tier 1: Mega-celebrities (>10M followers)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Never fan-out on write
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Always pull on read
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dedicated celebrity content servers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Special caching strategies
â”œâ”€â”€ Tier 2: Large influencers (1M-10M followers)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Selective fan-out to active followers only
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Lazy loading for inactive followers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Time-delayed fan-out processing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Batch processing optimizations
â””â”€â”€ Tier 3: Medium influencers (100K-1M followers)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Standard fan-out with rate limiting
    â”œâ”€â”€ Async processing of fan-out
    â”œâ”€â”€ Priority queuing for processing
    â””â”€â”€ Fallback to pull model during spikes
```
