### Cloud Deployment Models

#### 1. Public Cloud (Cloud-Based)
- Fully deployed in the cloud
- All parts of application run in the cloud
- Migration from existing infrastructure or new applications
- **Example**: Startup building new app on AWS

#### 2. Private Cloud (On-Premises)
- Resources deployed on-premises
- Virtualization and resource management tools
- Often for legacy applications or regulatory requirements
- **Example**: Bank with strict data regulations

#### 3. Hybrid Cloud
- Cloud-based resources connected to on-premises infrastructure
- Best of both worlds
- Gradual migration strategy
- **Example**: Company migrating workloads gradually to cloud

**📝 Exam Tip**: Know the difference between deployment models. Hybrid connects on-premises and cloud, while public cloud is fully in AWS.

## Module 2: AWS Global Infrastructure

### AWS Global Infrastructure Overview

AWS infrastructure is built around **Regions**, **Availability Zones**, and **Edge Locations**.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[AWS Global Infrastructure] --> B[Regions - 33+]
    A --> C[Availability Zones - 100+]
    A --> D[Edge Locations - 450+]
    A --> E[Regional Edge Caches]
    B --> F[US East N. Virginia]
    B --> G[EU Frankfurt]
    B --> H[Asia Pacific Tokyo]
    F --> I[AZ us-east-1a]
    F --> J[AZ us-east-1b]
    F --> K[AZ us-east-1c]
```

### Regions

**What is a Region?**
A geographical area containing multiple, isolated Availability Zones.

**Key Points:**
- AWS has 33+ Regions worldwide (as of 2024)
- Each Region is completely independent
- Data doesn't leave a Region unless you explicitly transfer it
- Region names: us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1, etc.

**Region Examples:**
- **US East (N. Virginia)**: us-east-1
- **US West (Oregon)**: us-west-2
- **EU (Ireland)**: eu-west-1
- **Asia Pacific (Singapore)**: ap-southeast-1
- **South America (São Paulo)**: sa-east-1

### Availability Zones (AZs)

**What is an AZ?**
One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in a Region.

**Key Points:**
- Each Region has 3 or more AZs (minimum 3)
- AZs are physically separated (different buildings)
- Connected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking
- Designed for fault isolation
- Named: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, etc.

**High Availability Pattern:**
Deploy applications across multiple AZs for fault tolerance.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Region: US East (N. Virginia)"
        subgraph "AZ us-east-1a"
            A1[EC2 Instance]
            A2[RDS Primary]
        end
        subgraph "AZ us-east-1b"
            B1[EC2 Instance]
            B2[RDS Standby]
        end
        subgraph "AZ us-east-1c"
            C1[EC2 Instance]
        end
    end
    LB[Load Balancer] --> A1
    LB --> B1
    LB --> C1
    A2 -.Replication.-> B2
```

### Edge Locations

**What are Edge Locations?**
Sites that CloudFront uses to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users.

**Key Points:**
- 450+ Edge Locations worldwide
- Separate from Regions and AZs
- Used by Amazon CloudFront (CDN)
- Also used by Route 53 (DNS)
- Located in major cities globally

**How Edge Locations Work:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User in Tokyo
    participant Edge in Tokyo
    participant Origin in US

    User in Tokyo->>Edge in Tokyo: Request content
    Edge in Tokyo->>Origin in US: First request (cache miss)
    Origin in US->>Edge in Tokyo: Return content
    Edge in Tokyo->>User in Tokyo: Deliver content (cached)
    Note over Edge in Tokyo: Content now cached
    User in Tokyo->>Edge in Tokyo: Subsequent requests
    Edge in Tokyo->>User in Tokyo: Deliver from cache (faster!)
```

### Regional Edge Caches

- Sit between CloudFront Edge Locations and origin servers
- Larger caches than Edge Locations
- Content stays cached longer
- Improves performance for less frequently accessed content

### How to Choose a Region

**Four Key Factors:**

#### 1. Compliance and Legal Requirements
- Data sovereignty laws
- Industry regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Example**: EU data must stay in EU regions

#### 2. Proximity to Customers (Latency)
- Choose Region closest to your users
- Reduces latency
- **Example**: Users in Australia → use ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)

#### 3. Available Services
- Not all services available in all Regions
- New services often launch in us-east-1 first
- Check AWS Regional Services List

#### 4. Pricing
- Pricing varies by Region
- Some Regions are more expensive (e.g., São Paulo)
- **Example**: S3 storage in us-east-1 may be cheaper than in ap-southeast-1

**📝 Exam Tip**: Remember all four factors for choosing a Region. Questions often ask about scenarios requiring specific Region choices.

- **Dedicated Hosts** = Regulatory/licensing requirements

#### EC2 Scaling

**Vertical Scaling**: Resize instance (scale up/down)
- Change instance type (t2.micro → t2.large)
- Requires restart

**Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances (scale out/in)
- Add or remove instances
- Better for high availability

**Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**
- Automatically add or remove EC2 instances
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Responds to changing demand
- **Predictive Scaling**: Uses ML to predict and schedule scaling
- **Target Tracking**: Maintain specific metric (e.g., CPU at 50%)
- **Minimum, Desired, Maximum Capacity**: Control scaling limits

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Auto Scaling Group] --> B[Minimum: 2 instances]
    A --> C[Desired: 4 instances]
    A --> D[Maximum: 10 instances]
    E[CloudWatch Alarm] -->|High CPU| F[Scale Out]
    G[CloudWatch Alarm] -->|Low CPU| H[Scale In]
    F --> A
    H --> A
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Edge Location
    participant Origin (S3/EC2)

    User->>Edge Location: Request content
    alt Content cached
        Edge Location->>User: Return cached content
    else Content not cached
        Edge Location->>Origin (S3/EC2): Fetch content
        Origin (S3/EC2)->>Edge Location: Return content
        Edge Location->>Edge Location: Cache content
        Edge Location->>User: Return content

### Shared Responsibility Model

**Critical Concept**: AWS and customer share responsibility for security.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Customer Responsibility - Security IN the Cloud"
        A[Customer Data]
        B[Platform, Applications, IAM]
        C[Operating System, Network, Firewall Config]
        D[Client-side Encryption]
        E[Server-side Encryption]
        F[Network Traffic Protection]
    end

    subgraph "AWS Responsibility - Security OF the Cloud"
        G[Software: Compute, Storage, Database, Networking]
        H[Hardware: Regions, AZs, Edge Locations]
        I[Physical Security of Data Centers]
    end

    style A fill:#ffcccc
    style B fill:#ffcccc
    style C fill:#ffcccc
    style D fill:#ffcccc
    style E fill:#ffcccc
    style F fill:#ffcccc
    style G fill:#ccffcc
    style H fill:#ccffcc
    style I fill:#ccffcc
```

**AWS Responsibility (Security OF the Cloud):**
- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and infrastructure
- Network infrastructure
- Virtualization infrastructure
- Managed services (RDS, Lambda, etc.)

**Customer Responsibility (Security IN the Cloud):**
- Customer data
- Applications

- Firewall configuration
- Encryption (data at rest and in transit)

**Service Categories:**

**Infrastructure Services (EC2):**
- AWS: Physical infrastructure, hypervisor
- Customer: OS, applications, data, firewall, encryption

**Container Services (RDS):**
- AWS: Infrastructure, OS, platform
- Customer: Data, access management, encryption settings

**Abstracted Services (S3, DynamoDB):**
- AWS: Most security responsibilities
- Customer: Data classification, encryption, access policies

**📝 Exam Tip**: Know the shared responsibility model cold. Questions often ask "Who is responsible for X?" Answer depends on service type.

### AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

**What is IAM?**
Service to securely control access to AWS resources.

**Key Components:**

#### 1. Users
- Represent a person or application
- Permanent long-term credentials
- **Best Practice**: Create individual users, not shared credentials

#### 2. Groups
- Collection of users
- Apply permissions to multiple users at once
- Users can belong to multiple groups
- **Example**: Developers group, Admins group, QA group

#### 3. Roles
- Temporary credentials
- Assumed by users, applications, or services
- **Use cases**:
  - EC2 instance accessing S3
  - Cross-account access
  - Federation (corporate directory)

#### 4. Policies
- JSON documents defining permissions
- **Types**:
  - **Identity-based**: Attached to users, groups, roles
  - **Resource-based**: Attached to resources (S3 bucket policy)
  - **AWS Managed**: Created and managed by AWS
  - **Customer Managed**: Created and managed by you
  - **Inline**: Embedded directly in user, group, or role

**Policy Structure:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Policy Evaluation Logic:**
1. By default, all requests are denied (implicit deny)
2. Explicit allow overrides implicit deny
3. Explicit deny overrides any allow

#### IAM Best Practices

✅ **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
- Root account always
- Privileged users
- Additional security layer

✅ **Follow Principle of Least Privilege**
- Grant only permissions needed
- Start with minimum permissions
- Add more as needed

✅ **Use Roles for Applications**
- EC2 instances use IAM roles
- Not hardcoded credentials

✅ **Rotate Credentials Regularly**
- Change passwords
- Rotate access keys

✅ **Use Policy Conditions**
- Add constraints (time, IP address, MFA)

✅ **Monitor Activity**
- CloudTrail logs API calls
- Access Advisor shows unused permissions

**Root User:**
- Email address used to create account
- **Has complete access** to all resources
- **Best Practice**: Don't use for everyday tasks
- **Use only for**: Account management tasks
- **Secure it**: Enable MFA, don't create access keys

**📝 Exam Tip**:
- Never use root account for daily tasks
- Users = long-term credentials, Roles = temporary credentials
- Always follow least privilege principle

### AWS Organizations

**What is AWS Organizations?**
Centrally manage multiple AWS accounts.

**Benefits:**
- **Consolidated billing**: Single payment for all accounts

graph TB
    A[Management Account Root] --> B[OU: Production]
    A --> C[OU: Development]
    A --> D[OU: Finance]
    B --> E[Account: Prod-WebApp]
    B --> F[Account: Prod-Database]
    C --> G[Account: Dev-Team1]
    C --> H[Account: Dev-Team2]
    D --> I[Account: Finance]
```

**Organizational Units (OUs):**
- Group accounts with similar needs
- Apply policies to OUs
- Can nest OUs (hierarchical structure)

**Service Control Policies (SCPs):**
- Control maximum permissions for accounts
- Don't grant permissions (only limit)
- Applied to OUs or accounts
- **Example**: Prevent accounts from leaving organization, restrict regions

**📝 Exam Tip**: Organizations provide consolidated billing and centralized control. SCPs limit permissions but don't grant them.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Confusing Similar Services
**Wrong**: Using EBS for shared file storage
**Right**: Use EFS for shared storage across multiple EC2 instances

**Wrong**: Using CloudWatch for API audit logs
**Right**: Use CloudTrail for API audit logs

### ❌ Mistake 2: Forgetting Regional Nature of Services
**Wrong**: Assuming IAM users are regional
**Right**: IAM is a global service

**Remember**:
- **Global Services**: IAM, CloudFront, Route 53, WAF
- **Regional Services**: EC2, S3, RDS, VPC

### ❌ Mistake 3: Misunderstanding Shared Responsibility
**Wrong**: Thinking AWS patches EC2 OS automatically
**Right**: Customer patches EC2 OS (but AWS patches RDS OS)

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Reading Questions Carefully
**Wrong**: Missing words like "MOST cost-effective" or "LEAST"
**Right**: Identify what the question is really asking

### ❌ Mistake 5: Overcomplicating Solutions
**Wrong**: Building custom solution when managed service exists
**Right**: Use AWS managed services when possible

### ❌ Mistake 6: Forgetting About Free Tier
**Wrong**: Thinking all AWS services cost money
**Right**: Many services have Always Free tier (Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.)

### ❌ Mistake 7: Confusing Multi-AZ and Read Replicas
