5. **What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` method?**
   - `==` compares references, `equals()` compares content

6. **What is method overloading?**
   - Same method name with different parameters in the same class

7. **What is method overriding?**
   - Child class provides specific implementation of parent class method

8. **What is the difference between `String`, `StringBuffer`, and `StringBuilder`?**

9. **What are access modifiers in Java?**
   - public, private, protected, default (package-private)

10. **What is the difference between instance and static variables?**
    - Instance variables belong to objects, static variables belong to class

### Object-Oriented Programming

11. **What are the four pillars of OOP?**
    - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

12. **What is inheritance and what are its types?**
    - Single, multilevel, hierarchical inheritance (multiple inheritance through interfaces)

13. **What is the difference between abstract class and interface?**
    - Abstract class can have concrete methods, interface has only abstract methods (before Java 8)

14. **What is encapsulation?**
    - Bundling data and methods together and hiding internal implementation

15. **What is polymorphism? Explain with example.**
    - One interface, multiple implementations (compile-time and runtime polymorphism)

### Control Structures and Exception Handling

16. **What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`?**
    - `final`: keyword, `finally`: block, `finalize`: method

17. **What is exception handling and its hierarchy?**
    - Throwable → Error/Exception → RuntimeException/Checked exceptions

18. **What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**
    - Checked: compile-time verification, Unchecked: runtime exceptions

19. **What is try-with-resources?**
    - Automatic resource management introduced in Java 7

20. **What are the different types of loops in Java?**
    - for, while, do-while, enhanced for loop

## **Intermediate Level (Questions 21-35)**

### Collections Framework

21. **What is the Java Collections Framework?**
    - Unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections

22. **What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?**
    - ArrayList: dynamic array, LinkedList: doubly linked list

23. **What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?**
    - HashMap is not synchronized, allows null values; Hashtable is synchronized

24. **What is the difference between Set and List?**
    - Set doesn't allow duplicates, List allows duplicates and maintains order

25. **What is Iterator and how is it different from Enumeration?**
    - Iterator is fail-fast and allows removal, Enumeration is fail-safe

26. **What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?**
    - Comparable: natural ordering, Comparator: custom ordering

27. **What is ConcurrentHashMap?**
    - Thread-safe version of HashMap without synchronizing entire map

### Multithreading

28. **What is multithreading and its benefits?**
    - Concurrent execution of threads for better performance and resource utilization

29. **What is the difference between Thread class and Runnable interface?**
    - Thread class vs implementing Runnable interface approach

30. **What is synchronization and why is it needed?**
    - Controlling access to shared resources by multiple threads

31. **What is the difference between `wait()` and `sleep()`?**
    - wait() releases lock, sleep() doesn't release lock

32. **What is deadlock and how to prevent it?**
    - Circular dependency of threads waiting for resources

### Memory Management

33. **What is garbage collection in Java?**
    - Automatic memory management to reclaim unused objects

34. **What are different types of garbage collectors?**
    - Serial, Parallel, G1, ZGC, etc.

35. **What is memory leak and how to prevent it?**
    - Objects not being garbage collected due to unintended references

---

## **Advanced Level (Questions 36-50)**

### Advanced Java Features

36. **What are generics and type erasure?**
    - Type safety at compile time, type information erased at runtime

37. **What is reflection in Java?**
    - Examining and manipulating classes, methods, fields at runtime

38. **What are annotations and how do they work?**
    - Metadata that provides information about code

39. **What is lambda expression and functional interfaces?**
    - Anonymous functions and interfaces with single abstract method

40. **What is Stream API?**
    - Functional-style operations on collections of objects

### Design Patterns and Architecture

41. **What is Singleton design pattern and its implementation?**
    - Ensures only one instance of a class exists

42. **What is Factory design pattern?**
    - Creates objects without specifying exact class to create

43. **What is Observer design pattern?**
    - One-to-many dependency between objects

44. **What is MVC architecture?**
    - Model-View-Controller separation of concerns

45. **What is dependency injection?**
    - Providing dependencies from external source rather than creating them

### Performance and Advanced Topics

46. **What is JVM memory structure?**
    - Heap, Stack, Method Area, PC Register, Native Method Stack

47. **What is the difference between heap and stack memory?**
    - Heap: objects storage, Stack: method calls and local variables

48. **What is classloader and its types?**
    - Bootstrap, Extension, Application classloaders

49. **What is serialization and deserialization?**
    - Converting objects to byte stream and vice versa

## **Study Tips for Each Level:**

### **Beginner Level Focus:**

- Master basic syntax and OOP concepts
- Practice writing simple programs
- Understand data types and control structures

### **Intermediate Level Focus:**

- Deep dive into Collections Framework
- Learn multithreading basics
- Understand exception handling thoroughly

### **Advanced Level Focus:**

---

## **Recommended Practice Approach:**

1. **Start with basics** - Ensure you understand fundamental concepts
2. **Code examples** - Write code for each concept
3. **Progress gradually** - Don't jump to advanced topics too quickly
4. **Practice coding** - Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank
5. **Build projects** - Apply concepts in real-world scenarios

Remember: Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing answers. Interviewers often ask follow-up questions to test your depth of knowledge!
