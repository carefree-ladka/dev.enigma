# OOP and Java 8 Interview Questions

## **Part A: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Interview Questions**

### **Beginner Level OOP Questions (1-15)**

#### Fundamental OOP Concepts

1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming?**
   - Programming paradigm based on objects containing data and methods

2. **What are the four pillars of OOP?**
   - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

3. **What is a class and object?**
   - Class: blueprint/template, Object: instance of a class

4. **What is encapsulation? Provide an example.**
   - Wrapping data and methods together, hiding internal implementation

   ```java
   class Person {
       private String name;
       public String getName() { return name; }
       public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
   }
   ```

5. **What is inheritance? What are its types?**
   - Mechanism to acquire properties of another class
   - Types: Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Multiple (through interfaces), Hybrid

6. **What is polymorphism? Explain its types.**
   - One interface, multiple implementations
   - Types: Compile-time (method overloading) and Runtime (method overriding)

7. **What is abstraction?**
   - Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features

8. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**
   - Abstraction: hiding complexity, Encapsulation: hiding data

9. **What is method overloading?**
   - Same method name with different parameters in same class

10. **What is method overriding?**
    - Child class provides specific implementation of parent class method

11. **What is the difference between overloading and overriding?**
    - Overloading: compile-time, same class; Overriding: runtime, different classes

12. **What is a constructor? What are its types?**
    - Special method to initialize objects
    - Types: Default, Parameterized, Copy constructor

13. **What is constructor overloading?**
    - Multiple constructors with different parameters

14. **What is the difference between constructor and method?**
    - Constructor initializes object, method performs operations

15. **What is `this` keyword?**
    - Reference to current object instance

### **Intermediate Level OOP Questions (16-25)**

16. **What is `super` keyword?**
    - Reference to parent class members

17. **What is the difference between `this()` and `super()`?**
    - this(): calls current class constructor, super(): calls parent constructor

18. **What is an abstract class?**
    - Class that cannot be instantiated, can have abstract and concrete methods

19. **What is an interface?**
    - Contract defining method signatures, pure abstraction (before Java 8)

20. **What is the difference between abstract class and interface?**
    - Abstract class: partial abstraction, Interface: complete abstraction
    - Abstract class: can have constructors, Interface: cannot

21. **Can we have multiple inheritance in Java? How?**
    - No through classes, Yes through interfaces

22. **What is composition?**
    - "Has-a" relationship, object contains other objects

23. **What is aggregation?**
    - Special form of association, "has-a" relationship with independent lifecycle

24. **What is the difference between composition and inheritance?**
    - Composition: "has-a", Inheritance: "is-a"

25. **What is association, aggregation, and composition?**

   Predicate<String> isEmpty = s -> s.isEmpty();
   ```

7. **What is Function functional interface?**
   - Takes one argument, returns a result

   ```java
   Function<String, Integer> length = s -> s.length();
   ```

8. **What is Consumer functional interface?**
   - Takes one argument, returns nothing (void)

   ```java
   Consumer<String> print = s -> System.out.println(s);
   ```

9. **What is Supplier functional interface?**
   - Takes no argument, returns a result

   ```java
   Supplier<String> supplier = () -> "Hello World";
   ```

10. **What are method references?**
    - Shorthand notation for lambda expressions
    - Types: Static, Instance, Constructor, Instance of arbitrary object

11. **What are the types of method references?**
    - Static: Class::staticMethod
    - Instance: object::instanceMethod
    - Constructor: Class::new
    - Instance of arbitrary object: Class::instanceMethod

12. **What is the difference between lambda expression and method reference?**
    - Method reference is shorthand for lambda when calling existing method

13. **Can we use lambda expressions with any interface?**
    - No, only with functional interfaces

14. **What is the difference between lambda and anonymous inner class?**
    - Lambda: functional interfaces only, Anonymous class: any interface/abstract class

## **Common Coding Examples**

### **OOP Example:**

```java
// Encapsulation + Inheritance + Polymorphism
abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;

    public Animal(String name) { this.name = name; }

    public abstract void makeSound();

    public void sleep() { System.out.println(name + " is sleeping"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) { super(name); }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() { System.out.println(name + " barks"); }
}
```

### **Java 8 Example:**

```java
// Lambda + Stream + Optional
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");

Optional<String> result = names.stream()
    .filter(name -> name.startsWith("C"))
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .findFirst();

result.ifPresent(System.out::println); // CHARLIE
```
