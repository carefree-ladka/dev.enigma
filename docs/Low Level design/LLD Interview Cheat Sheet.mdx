## 1️⃣ Requirements Clarification (8-10 min)

### ✅ Questions to Ask:

```
🔍 FUNCTIONAL:
- What are the core features?
- Who are the users?
- What operations are needed?
- Any specific business rules?

🔍 NON-FUNCTIONAL:
- How many users/requests?
- Performance requirements?
- Consistency vs Availability?
- Storage constraints?

🔍 SCOPE:
- What's included/excluded?
- Mobile app needed?
- Payment integration?
- Real-time updates?
```

### 🎯 Output: Clear requirements list

---

## 2️⃣ Core Entities & Relationships (8-10 min)

### ✅ Find Nouns (Classes):

```
Example: "Park vehicle in parking lot, generate ticket"
→ Vehicle, ParkingLot, ParkingSlot, Ticket
```

### ✅ Define Relationships:

```
IS-A (Inheritance):     Car IS-A Vehicle
HAS-A (Composition):    ParkingLot HAS-A List<Slot>
USES-A (Association):   Ticket USES Vehicle + Slot
```

### 🚨 **Abstract vs Interface Decision**:

- **Abstract**: Shared attributes + some behavior (Vehicle → Car, Bike)
- **Interface**: Contract/capability (Payable, Notifiable)

---

## 3️⃣ Class Design (10-12 min) - MOST CRITICAL

### ✅ For Each Class Define:

```java
Class Name
├── Attributes (private/protected)
├── Responsibilities (what it does)
├── Key methods (public interface)
└── Relationships to other classes
```

### 🎯 OOP Principles Checklist:

- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Private fields, public getters/setters
- ✅ **Inheritance**: Proper IS-A relationships
- ✅ **Polymorphism**: Abstract methods, overriding
- ✅ **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation

### 🚨 **Design Principles (SOLID)**:

- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class, one job
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subclasses should be replaceable
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

---

## 4️⃣ Interface Definition (6-8 min)

### ✅ Define Method Contracts:

```java
public interface ParkingSystem {
    ParkingTicket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) throws NoSlotException;
    boolean unparkVehicle(String ticketId) throws InvalidTicketException;
    int getAvailableSlots(VehicleType type);
    double calculateFee(String ticketId);
}
```

### 🎯 Method Design Tips:

- Clear method names (no ambiguity)
- Proper return types
- Exception handling strategy
- Parameter validation

---

## 5️⃣ Implementation (12-15 min)

### ✅ Code Structure Priority:

1. **Core classes first** (2-3 main classes)
2. **Key methods only** (not all getters/setters)
3. **Main controller/manager class**
4. **Basic logic** (don't perfect syntax)

### 🎯 What to Show in Code:

```java
// ✅ Show inheritance
abstract class Vehicle {
    protected String id;
    public abstract VehicleType getType();
}

// ✅ Show composition
class ParkingLot {
    private List<ParkingSlot> slots;
    private Map<String, Ticket> tickets;
}

// ✅ Show polymorphism
public ParkingTicket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // Different logic based on vehicle.getType()
}
```

### 🚨 **Quick Implementation Tips**:

- Use enums for constants (VehicleType, SlotType)
- Collections for storage (List, Map, Set)
- Exception handling (custom exceptions)
- Basic validation logic

---

## 6️⃣ Edge Cases & Extensions (5-8 min)

### ✅ Common Edge Cases:

```
🚨 FAILURE SCENARIOS:
- No available slots
- Invalid ticket/ID
- Duplicate operations
- Concurrent access issues
- Invalid input data

💡 VALIDATIONS:
- Null checks
- Range validations
- State validations
- Business rule violations
```

### ✅ Design Patterns (Mention if Time):

```
🎯 COMMON PATTERNS:
- Factory: Creating vehicles/slots
- Singleton: ParkingLot instance
- Strategy: Different pricing strategies
- Observer: Notify on slot availability
- Command: Parking operations
- State: Slot states (occupied/free)
```

### ✅ Scaling Considerations:

```
📈 SCALABILITY:
- Database persistence
- Caching (Redis)
- Load balancing
- Microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Thread safety (synchronized, locks)
```

## ⏰ Time Management Checkpoints

| Time       | Checkpoint                   | If Behind                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **15 min** | Requirements + Entities done | Skip some clarifying questions    |
| **25 min** | Class design complete        | Combine class design + interfaces |
| **40 min** | Core implementation done     | Show skeleton only                |
| **50 min** | Edge cases discussed         | Quick summary of extensions       |

---

## 🎯 Interview Success Formula

### 📢 **Communication Tips**:

```
🗣️ SPEAK YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS:
- "Let me clarify the requirements first..."
- "I see three main entities here..."
- "I'm running short on time, so I'll focus on..."
- "This is how I'd handle this edge case..."
```

### 🎯 **Prioritization Strategy**:

```
HIGH IMPACT:
✅ Complete requirements understanding
✅ Clean OOP design
✅ Working core implementation
✅ Clear communication

MEDIUM IMPACT:
⚡ Interface contracts
⚡ Edge case handling
⚡ Design patterns mention

LOW IMPACT:
🔹 Perfect syntax
🔹 Complete implementation
🔹 Advanced scalability discussion
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ **DON'T**                  | ✅ **DO**                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Spend 20+ min on requirements | 8-10 min max, then move          |
| Perfect code syntax           | Focus on structure & logic       |
| Implement every method        | Show key methods, mention others |
| Over-engineer with patterns   | Simple design first              |
| Silent coding                 | Explain your thinking            |
| Jump to code immediately      | Design first, code later         |
