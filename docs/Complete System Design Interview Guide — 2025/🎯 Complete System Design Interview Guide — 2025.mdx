## 💡 Final Tips for Success

### LLD Tips

- ✨ Always start with requirements gathering
- ✨ Think extensibility, not just functionality
- ✨ Use design patterns judiciously (don't over-engineer)
- ✨ Write self-documenting code
- ✨ Handle edge cases explicitly
- ✨ Be ready to modify your design based on new requirements

### HLD Tips

- ✨ **Think aloud** — Let interviewer follow your thought process
- ✨ **Start simple, then scale** — Don't jump to distributed systems immediately
- ✨ **Numbers matter** — Do rough calculations to justify decisions
- ✨ **Trade-offs are key** — Everything is a trade-off; articulate them clearly
- ✨ **No silver bullets** — Acknowledge limitations of your approach
- ✨ **Ask clarifying questions** — Better to ask than assume
- ✨ **Focus on breadth first** — Cover all components before deep-diving
- ✨ **Be pragmatic** — Real-world constraints matter (cost, team size, timeline)

### Communication Tips

- 🗣️ Structure your thoughts before speaking
- 🗣️ Use diagrams liberally
- 🗣️ Admit when you don't know something
- 🗣️ Ask for hints if stuck (shows humility)
- 🗣️ Summarize decisions at key points
- 🗣️ Engage with interviewer — it's a conversation, not a presentation
