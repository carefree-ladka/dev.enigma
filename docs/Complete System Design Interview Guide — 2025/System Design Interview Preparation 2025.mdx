- Reads from replicas
- Asynchronous replication
- Replication lag possible

**Use Cases:**
- Read-heavy applications
- Analytics on replicas
- Geographic distribution

**Master-Master:**
- Both can accept writes
- Conflict resolution needed
- More complex

---

### 2. **Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning)** 🔥🔥🔥

**Sharding Strategies:**

**1. Range-Based Sharding:**
- Users A-M → Shard 1
- Users N-Z → Shard 2
- Pros: Simple, range queries easy
- Cons: Uneven distribution (hotspots)

**2. Hash-Based Sharding:**
- Hash(user_id) % num_shards
- Pros: Even distribution
- Cons: Range queries difficult, resharding hard

**3. Consistent Hashing:**
- Virtual nodes on hash ring
- Pros: Minimal data movement when scaling
- Cons: More complex

**4. Directory-Based:**
- Lookup table maps keys to shards
- Pros: Flexible
- Cons: Single point of failure (directory service)

**Challenges:**
- Cross-shard queries
- Distributed transactions
- Resharding (when adding shards)
- Hotspot handling

---

### 3. **Partitioning (Vertical)** 🔥

**Split tables by columns:**
- User basic info → Shard 1
- User extended profile → Shard 2

**Benefits:**
- Reduce I/O
- Different storage types for different data

---

### 4. **Denormalization** 🔥🔥

**Purpose:**
- Optimize read performance

**Example:**
```
Normalized:
Users: user_id, name
Posts: post_id, user_id, content

Denormalized:
Posts: post_id, user_id, user_name, content
(user_name duplicated)
```

---

### 5. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** 🔥

**Concept:**
- Separate read and write models
- Optimize each independently

**Architecture:**
```
Write Model (Commands) → PostgreSQL (normalized)
                       ↓ (sync via events)
Read Model (Queries) → Elasticsearch (denormalized)
```

**Use Cases:**

## 9️⃣ Interview Strategy & Framework 🎯

### **The RESHADED Framework** (45-60 min interview)

**Timeline:**

**1. Requirements (5-7 minutes)** 🔥🔥🔥
- Clarify functional requirements
- Clarify non-functional requirements
- Ask about scale
- Identify constraints

**Example Questions to Ask:**
- "How many users are we expecting?"
- "What's the read/write ratio?"
- "Do we need strong consistency or eventual consistency?"
- "What's the expected latency?"
- "Do we need to support offline mode?"
- "What are the most critical features?"

---

**2. Estimations (5 minutes)** 🔥🔥

**Back-of-envelope Calculations:**

**Example: Design Instagram**
```
DAU (Daily Active Users): 500M
Assumptions:
- Each user posts 1 photo/day
- Each photo is 2MB
- Each user views 50 photos/day

Storage:
- Daily: 500M * 1 * 2MB = 1,000 TB/day = 1 PB/day
- Yearly: 1 PB * 365 = 365 PB/year

Bandwidth:
Read:
- 500M * 50 * 2MB / 86400 seconds = ~580 GB/s

Write:
- 500M * 1 * 2MB / 86400 seconds = ~11.6 GB/s

QPS:
Read: 500M * 50 / 86400 = ~289K QPS
Write: 500M * 1 / 86400 = ~5.8K QPS
```

**Memory Estimates (80-20 Rule):**
- Cache 20% of daily traffic
- 80% of requests hit cache

**Useful Numbers:**
```
1 Million requests/day = ~12 requests/second
1 Billion requests/day = ~12K requests/second
1 Petabyte = 1,000 Terabytes = 1,000,000 Gigabytes
1 Day = 86,400 seconds
```

---

**3. System Interface / API Design (5 minutes)** 🔥🔥

**Define APIs:**

**Example: Twitter**
```
POST /api/v1/tweets
Body: { user_id, content, media_urls }
Response: { tweet_id, created_at }

GET /api/v1/timeline/{user_id}
Params: page, limit
Response: { tweets: [...], next_page_token }

POST /api/v1/follow
Body: { follower_id, followee_id }
Response: { success: true }

GET /api/v1/search
Params: query, page, limit
Response: { tweets: [...], users: [...] }
```

**Important:**
- Define request/response structure
- Mention authentication (JWT, OAuth)

                              ↓              ↓
                          Database ← (cache miss)
                              ↓
                          Kafka → Workers
                              ↓
                          S3 (media files)
```

- "How would you handle failures?"
- "What about data consistency?"

**Discuss Trade-offs:**
- Consistency vs Availability vs Partition Tolerance (CAP)
- Latency vs Throughput
- Cost vs Performance
- Complexity vs Simplicity

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Database down → Read from replicas

---

## 🔟 Common Interview Questions & Answers 🔥

### Generic Questions

**Q: "SQL vs NoSQL - when to use what?"**

**Answer:**
```
Use SQL when:
✅ ACID transactions required (banking, e-commerce orders)
✅ Complex queries with JOINs
✅ Structured data
✅ Data integrity is critical

Use NoSQL when:
✅ High write throughput (logging, IoT)
✅ Flexible schema (user profiles)
✅ Horizontal scaling needed
✅ Eventual consistency acceptable
✅ Key-value access patterns

Examples:
- E-commerce orders → SQL (PostgreSQL)
- User sessions → NoSQL (Redis)
- Product catalog → NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Social media feeds → NoSQL (Cassandra)
```

---

**Q: "How do you prevent race conditions in distributed systems?"**

**Answer:**
```
1. Distributed Locks (Redis, ZooKeeper)
2. Optimistic Locking (version numbers)
3. Database Transactions (ACID)
4. Idempotency (same request = same result)
5. Atomic operations (INCR in Redis)

Example: Prevent double booking
- Acquire distributed lock on resource_id
- Check availability
- Make booking
- Release lock

Use Redis: SETNX key value
If returns 1 → lock acquired
If returns 0 → lock already held
```

---

**Q: "How do you handle high traffic / flash sales?"**

**Answer:**
```
1. Rate Limiting (per user, per IP)
2. Queue System (virtual waiting room)
3. Caching (aggressive caching of product details)
4. CDN (static content)
5. Database Optimization:
   - Read replicas
   - Connection pooling
6. Horizontal Scaling (auto-scaling)
7. Graceful Degradation:
   - Disable non-critical features
   - Show cached data
8. Pre-warming Cache
9. Bot Detection (CAPTCHA)

Example: iPhone launch on Amazon
- Queue 1M users → virtual waiting room
- Release in batches (1000 at a time)
- Rate limit checkouts
- Reserve inventory with distributed locks
```

---

**Q: "How do you ensure data consistency across microservices?"**

**Answer:**
```
1. Saga Pattern (distributed transactions)
   - Choreography (event-driven)
   - Orchestration (coordinator)

2. Event Sourcing
   - Store events, not state
   - Replay events to rebuild state

3. 2PC (Two-Phase Commit)
   - Coordinator asks: Can you commit?
   - All say yes → Commit
   - Any says no → Rollback
   - Problem: Blocking, coordinator SPOF

4. Eventual Consistency
   - Accept temporary inconsistency
   - Use message queues for async updates

Example: Order Service + Payment Service + Inventory Service
Saga Pattern:
1. Order Service creates order (pending)
2. Payment Service charges card → Success
3. Inventory Service decrements stock → Success
4. Order Service updates order (confirmed)

If any step fails → Compensating transactions (rollback)
```

---

**Q: "How do you handle failures and ensure reliability?"**

**Answer:**
```
1. Redundancy
   - Multiple instances
   - No single point of failure

2. Replication
   - Database replicas
   - Cross-region replication

3. Health Checks
   - Liveness probes
   - Readiness probes

4. Circuit Breaker
   - Fail fast when service down
   - Prevent cascading failures

5. Retry with Exponential Backoff
   - Don't overwhelm failing service

6. Bulkhead Pattern
   - Isolate resources (thread pools)
   - Failure in one area doesn't affect others

7. Graceful Degradation
   - Serve cached/stale data
   - Disable non-critical features

8. Monitoring & Alerts
   - Real-time metrics
   - On-call rotation
```

---

**Q: "How do you optimize database queries?"**

**Answer:**
```
1. Indexing
   - B-tree indexes for range queries
   - Hash indexes for equality
   - Composite indexes for multiple columns
   - Don't over-index (slows writes)

2. Query Optimization
   - Use EXPLAIN to analyze
   - Avoid SELECT *
   - Use JOINs wisely
   - Limit result sets

3. Caching
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Redis, Memcached

4. Denormalization
   - Pre-compute aggregations
   - Duplicate data to avoid JOINs

5. Partitioning
   - Horizontal (sharding)
   - Vertical (split columns)

6. Read Replicas
   - Route reads to replicas

7. Connection Pooling
   - Reuse connections

8. Pagination
   - Don't fetch all at once
   - Cursor-based or offset-based
```

**Closing:**
"Would you like me to deep dive into any specific component?"
"Are there any edge cases you'd like me to consider?"

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them 🚨

### **Mistake 1: Jumping to Solution**
**Problem:** Starting design without understanding requirements

**Solution:**
- Spend 5-7 minutes on requirements
- Ask about functional and non-functional requirements
- Clarify scale and constraints

**Example:**
❌ "Let me design Twitter..." (starts drawing)
✅ "Before I start, can we discuss the key features? Are we focusing on tweets, timeline, search, or all of them?"

---

### **Mistake 2: Not Estimating**
**Problem:** Ignoring back-of-envelope calculations

**Solution:**
- Always do rough calculations
- Shows you understand scale
- Helps make informed decisions

**Example:**
✅ "With 100M DAU and 10 posts per user, we're looking at 1B posts/day. That's about 12K writes/second. We'll need to optimize for writes."

---

### **Mistake 3: Using Buzzwords Without Understanding**
**Problem:** Mentioning technologies without explaining why

**Solution:**
- Only mention technologies you understand
- Explain the reason for choosing them
- Be ready to discuss alternatives

**Example:**
❌ "We'll use Kubernetes and Kafka"
✅ "We'll use Kafka for asynchronous processing because it provides high throughput, message persistence, and the ability to replay messages if needed. We could also use RabbitMQ, but Kafka is better for our high-volume use case."

---

### **Mistake 4: Not Discussing Trade-offs**
**Problem:** Presenting design as the only solution

**Solution:**
- Every decision has trade-offs
- Discuss pros and cons
- Show you considered alternatives

**Example:**
✅ "For the feed generation, we have two approaches:
1. Fan-out on write: Fast reads but slow writes for celebrities
2. Fan-out on read: Fast writes but slow reads
I suggest a hybrid approach where normal users use fan-out on write and celebrities use fan-out on read."

---

### **Mistake 5: Over-complicating Simple Problems**
**Problem:** Adding unnecessary complexity

**Solution:**
- Start simple
- Add complexity only when justified by scale
- Explain when you'd add more complexity

**Example:**
For 10K users:
✅ Simple: Single database, load balancer, CDN
❌ Overengineered: Microservices, Kafka, multiple data centers, sharding

For 100M users:
✅ All of the above makes sense

---

### **Mistake 6: Ignoring Failures**
**Problem:** Only discussing happy path

**Solution:**
- Discuss failure scenarios
- Explain recovery mechanisms
- Show you think about reliability

**Example:**
✅ "If the primary database fails:
1. Health check detects failure
2. Load balancer stops routing to it
3. Promote read replica to primary
4. Update DNS
5. Bring old primary back as replica"

---

### **Mistake 7: Not Managing Time**
**Problem:** Spending too long on one part

**Solution:**
- Follow RESHADED framework
- Allocate time for each section
- Move on if you're taking too long

**Time Allocation (60-min interview):**
- Requirements: 5-7 min
- Estimations: 5 min
- API Design: 5 min
- High-level Design: 10-15 min
- Detailed Design: 15-20 min
- Database: 5-7 min
- Scalability: 5-7 min
- Deep Dives: 5-10 min

---

### **Mistake 8: Not Drawing Diagrams**
**Problem:** Explaining verbally without visuals

**Solution:**
- Always draw architecture diagrams
- Use boxes and arrows
- Label components clearly

**Good Diagram Elements:**
```
[Client] → [Load Balancer] → [App Servers]
                                    ↓
                            [Cache] [Database]
                                    ↓
                            [Message Queue]
                                    ↓
                                [Workers]
```

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Sample Interview Walkthrough 🎬

### **Problem: Design TinyURL (URL Shortener)**

---

**1. Requirements Clarification (5 min)**

**Candidate:**
"Let me make sure I understand the requirements. We need to build a URL shortening service like bit.ly. Let me clarify a few things:

**Functional Requirements:**
- Shorten a long URL to a short URL
- Redirect short URL to original URL
- Custom short URLs? (bit.ly/my-custom-link)
- Analytics on clicks?
- Expiration of URLs?

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- How many URLs shortened per day?
- Read-to-write ratio?
- Expected latency for redirection?
- How long to store URLs?
- High availability needed?"

**Interviewer:**
"Good questions. Let's focus on:
- 100M new URLs per day
- Read:Write ratio is 100:1 (10B redirects per day)
- Latency < 100ms for redirects
- Store for 5 years
- Yes, high availability (99.9%)
- No custom URLs, no analytics for now"

---

**2. Estimations (5 min)**

**Candidate:**
"Let me do some back-of-envelope calculations:

**Traffic:**
- Writes: 100M URLs/day = 100M/(24*3600) ≈ 1,160 URLs/sec
- Reads: 10B redirects/day = 10B/(24*3600) ≈ 115,700 redirects/sec

**Storage:**
- Each URL entry: 500 bytes (original URL + short URL + metadata)
- Daily: 100M * 500 bytes = 50 GB/day
- 5 years: 50 GB * 365 * 5 = 91 TB

**Cache:**
- 20% of URLs generate 80% of traffic (80-20 rule)
- Cache 20% of daily reads: 10B * 0.2 * 500 bytes = 1 TB

**Bandwidth:**
- Reads: 115,700 req/s * 500 bytes = 58 MB/s
- Writes: 1,160 req/s * 500 bytes = 0.58 MB/s

So we're looking at high read traffic, significant storage, and need for caching."

---

**3. API Design (5 min)**

**Candidate:**
"Let me define the APIs:

**1. Create Short URL**
```
POST /api/v1/shorten
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body: {
  "original_url": "https://example.com/very/long/url"
}
Response: {
  "short_url": "https://tiny.url/abc123",
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**2. Redirect**
```
GET /{short_code}
Response: 301 Redirect to original URL
Location: https://example.com/very/long/url
```

We'll use 301 (permanent redirect) for SEO benefits and caching."

---

**4. High-Level Design (10 min)**

**Candidate draws:**
```
[Client]
   ↓
[Load Balancer]
   ↓
[API Gateway] → [Cache (Redis)]
   ↓                    ↓
[App Servers] ←────────┘
   ↓
[Database (NoSQL - Cassandra)]
   ↓
[ZooKeeper] (for ID generation)
```

**Candidate explains:**
"Here's the high-level architecture:

1. **Load Balancer** - Distributes traffic across app servers
2. **API Gateway** - Authentication, rate limiting
3. **App Servers** - Stateless application servers
4. **Cache (Redis)** - Cache popular short URLs (read-heavy)
5. **Database (Cassandra)** - Store URL mappings (high write throughput)
6. **ZooKeeper** - Coordinate ID generation

**Flow for Creating Short URL:**
1. Client sends POST request
2. App server generates unique short code
3. Store mapping in database
4. Return short URL

**Flow for Redirect:**
1. Client requests short URL
2. Check cache first
3. If cache miss, query database
4. Update cache
5. Redirect to original URL"

---

**5. Detailed Design - Short Code Generation (10 min)**

**Interviewer:** "How would you generate the short code?"

**Candidate:**
"Great question. Let me discuss a few approaches:

**Approach 1: Hash-based (MD5, SHA-256)**
- Hash the original URL
- Take first 6-7 characters
- **Problem:** Collisions possible
- **Solution:** Check for collision, append counter if collision

**Approach 2: Random Generation**
- Generate random alphanumeric string
- Check if exists in database
- **Problem:** Collision rate increases with more URLs
- **Problem:** Database query on every generation

**Approach 3: Counter-based (My Recommendation)**
- Use distributed counter
- Convert to base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- **Benefits:** Guaranteed unique, no collisions, fast

**Let me detail Approach 3:**

**Counter Service:**
- ZooKeeper maintains counter ranges
- Each app server gets a range (e.g., 1M-2M)
- Convert counter to base62

**Example:**
```
Counter: 1234567890
Base62: aB3cD8 (6-7 characters)
URL: tiny.url/aB3cD8
```

**How many URLs can we support?**
- 6 characters: 62^6 = 56.8 billion URLs
- 7 characters: 62^7 = 3.5 trillion URLs

7 characters is sufficient for our needs."

---

**6. Database Design (5 min)**

**Candidate:**
"For the database, I'm choosing Cassandra (NoSQL) because:
- High write throughput (1,160 writes/sec)
- Horizontal scaling
- Tunable consistency

**Schema:**
```
Table: url_mappings
Primary Key: short_code
Columns:
- short_code (string, 7 chars)
- original_url (string)
- created_at (timestamp)
- expires_at (timestamp)
- user_id (string, optional)

Partition key: short_code (even distribution)
```

**Why not SQL?**
- Don't need complex queries/JOINs
- Need horizontal scaling
- Eventual consistency is acceptable

**Indexing:**
- Primary index on short_code (for fast lookups)
- No secondary index needed for now"

---

**7. Caching Strategy (5 min)**

**Interviewer:** "How would you handle caching?"

**Candidate:**
"Given 100:1 read-to-write ratio, caching is critical:

**Cache Layer: Redis**
- Key: short_code
- Value: original_url
- TTL: 24 hours (popular URLs stay in cache)

**Cache Strategy: Cache-Aside**
1. Check cache first
2. If hit, return (most common case)
3. If miss, query database
4. Store in cache with TTL
5. Return result

**Cache Eviction: LRU**
- Automatically evict least recently used URLs
- 80-20 rule: 20% of URLs account for 80% of traffic

**Cache Size:**
- 1 TB cache can hold 2 billion entries (500 bytes each)
- More than enough for hot URLs

**Write Flow:**
- Write to database
- Don't write to cache (lazy loading)
- Cache will be populated on first read"

---

**8. Scalability & Bottlenecks (5 min)**

**Interviewer:** "How would you scale this system?"

**Candidate:**
"Let me identify bottlenecks and solutions:

**1. Database Bottleneck:**
- **Problem:** Single database can't handle 115K reads/sec
- **Solution:**
  - Shard by short_code (hash-based sharding)
  - Multiple Cassandra nodes
  - Each node handles a range of short codes

**2. Cache Bottleneck:**
- **Problem:** Single Redis instance has memory limit
- **Solution:**
  - Redis Cluster (sharding)
  - Multiple Redis replicas for read scaling

**3. ID Generation Bottleneck:**
- **Problem:** Single counter service is SPOF
- **Solution:**
  - Multiple ZooKeeper nodes
  - Each app server gets a range of IDs
  - Failover mechanism

**4. Network Bottleneck:**
- **Problem:** 58 MB/s bandwidth for redirects
- **Solution:**
  - CDN for caching redirects
  - Geo-distributed servers

**Scaling Numbers:**
```
Current: 115K redirects/sec
Per server capacity: 1K redirects/sec
Needed: 115K/1K = 115 servers

With 3x redundancy and peak load:
115 * 3 * 2 = 690 servers

Distributed across regions: ~100 servers per region
```"

---

**9. Deep Dive - Analytics (5 min)**

**Interviewer:** "If we want to add analytics, how would you do it?"

**Candidate:**
"For analytics, I'd use an async approach:

**Architecture Addition:**
```
[App Server] → [Kafka] → [Analytics Service]
                            ↓
                    [Time-Series DB (InfluxDB)]
                            ↓
                    [Analytics Dashboard]
```

**Metrics to Track:**
- Click count per short URL
- Geographic distribution
- Device types (mobile, desktop)
- Referrer sources
- Time-series data (clicks over time)

**Flow:**
1. User clicks short URL
2. App server logs event to Kafka (async, non-blocking)
3. Analytics service consumes from Kafka
4. Process and aggregate data
5. Store in time-series database
6. Dashboard queries for visualizations

**Why Async?**
- Don't slow down redirects (critical path)
- Decouple redirect service from analytics
- Analytics can be eventual consistent

**Database for Analytics:**
- InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (time-series optimized)
- Pre-aggregate data (hourly, daily)
- Separate from main database (different access patterns)"

---

**10. Wrap-up & Trade-offs (3 min)**

**Candidate:**
"Let me summarize the key trade-offs in this design:

**1. Cassandra vs PostgreSQL:**
- ✅ Cassandra: Better write throughput, horizontal scaling
- ❌ Cassandra: Eventual consistency
- For our use case, availability > consistency

**2. Counter-based vs Hash-based ID:**
- ✅ Counter: No collisions, predictable
- ❌ Counter: Coordination overhead, sequential (potential security issue)
- Could use random component for unpredictability

**3. 301 vs 302 Redirect:**
- 301 (Permanent): Browsers cache, CDN friendly, less tracking
- 302 (Temporary): No caching, better for analytics
- Choice depends on whether we prioritize speed or detailed analytics

**4. Cache-Aside vs Write-Through:**
- ✅ Cache-Aside: Better for read-heavy
- Simpler, lazy loading

**Future Improvements:**
- Custom short URLs
- Analytics dashboard
- A/B testing for redirect pages
- Spam detection
- Rate limiting per user

Are there any specific areas you'd like me to expand on?"
