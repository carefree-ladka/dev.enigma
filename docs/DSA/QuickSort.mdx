# Quick Sort

**Quick Sort** is a widely used and efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

## How Quick Sort Works

Quick Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`. Its efficiency depends on the choice of the pivot and partitioning strategy. The basic idea is to sort the array in place, with minimal additional memory usage.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Choose a Pivot:** Select an element from the array as the pivot. Various strategies can be used to choose the pivot (e.g., first element, last element, random element, median-of-three).
2. **Partition the Array:** Rearrange the elements in the array so that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements greater than the pivot come after it.
3. **Recursively Apply Quick Sort:** Recursively apply Quick Sort to the sub-arrays formed by the partition.

### Pseudocode

Hereâ€™s the pseudocode for Quick Sort:

```Javascript
function quickSort(arr, left = 0, right = arr.length - 1) {
    if (left >= right) return;

    const pivotIndex = partition(arr, left, right);
    quickSort(arr, left, pivotIndex - 1);
    quickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, right);
}

function partition(arr, left, right) {
    const pivot = arr[right];
    let i = left;

    for (let j = left; j < right; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < pivot) {
            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
            i++;
        }
    }

    [arr[i], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[i]];  // Swap pivot into place
    return i;
}

// Example usage
const array = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1];
quickSort(array);
console.log(array);  // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]
