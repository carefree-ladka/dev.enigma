## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a classic algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It works well with graphs where all edge weights are non-negative. The algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the distance to the source node to `0` and all other nodes to infinity.
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to store nodes with their distances.

2. **Process Nodes**:
   - Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
   - Update the distances to its neighboring nodes.
   - If a shorter path is found, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.

3. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm terminates when all nodes have been processed, or the priority queue is empty.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Initialize Distances**:
```Javascript
function dijkstra(graph, start) {
  const distances = {};
  const prev = {};
  const pq = new MinHeap();

  // Initialize distances and priority queue
  for (const node in graph) {
    distances[node] = Infinity;
    prev[node] = null;
  }
  distances[start] = 0;
  pq.enqueue(start, 0);

  while (pq.heap.length > 0) {
    const { node: u } = pq.dequeue();

    for (const neighbor in graph[u]) {
      const alt = distances[u] + graph[u][neighbor];
      if (alt < distances[neighbor]) {
        distances[neighbor] = alt;
        prev[neighbor] = u;
        pq.enqueue(neighbor, alt);
      }
    }
  }

  return { distances, prev };
}

// Example usage:
const graph = {
  A: { B: 1, C: 4 },
  B: { C: 2, D: 5 },
  C: { D: 1 },
  D: {}
};

const { distances, prev } = dijkstra(graph, 'A');
```
