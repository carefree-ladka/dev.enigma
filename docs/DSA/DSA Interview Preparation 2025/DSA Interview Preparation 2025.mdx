## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### 1. **Pattern Recognition Over Memorization**
- Understand WHY a solution works
- Identify similar problems by pattern
- Build a mental catalog of techniques

### 2. **Master "Top K" and "Kth Largest/Smallest" Problems**
- These are extremely common in interviews
- Use heap (priority queue) as first instinct
- Know when to use min-heap vs max-heap
- Practice quick-select for O(n) average case

### 3. **Trie Problems Are Gold**
- Less common but HIGH impact when asked
- Master the basic implementation first
- Understand prefix vs suffix operations
- Combine with backtracking for harder problems

### 4. **Interval Problems Have Patterns**
- Sort by start time (usually)
- Use greedy approach (often)
- Think about sweep line algorithm
- Min heap for overlapping intervals

### 5. **Time Complexity First**
- Always analyze brute force first
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize step by step

### 6. **Practice Articulation**
- Explain your thought process aloud
- Practice with timer (45 minutes per problem)
- Use mock interviews

### 7. **Quality Over Quantity**
- Solve each problem 2-3 times over weeks
- Understand all edge cases
- Can you solve it in a different way?

### 8. **Company-Specific Focus**
- **FAANG**: Heavy on DP, graphs, Top K problems
- **Microsoft/Amazon**: Trees, intervals, system design
- **Google**: DP, graphs, complex problems
- **Startups**: More practical, API design

|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Array | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Stack | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Queue | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Singly-Linked List | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Doubly-Linked List | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Hash Table | - | O(1)* | O(1)* | O(1)* | O(n) |
| Binary Search Tree | O(log n)* | O(log n)* | O(log n)* | O(log n)* | O(n) |
| Heap (Min/Max) | O(1) | O(n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Trie | O(k) | O(k) | O(k) | O(k) | O(n*k) |

## üí™ Motivation & Mindset

### Remember:
1. **Everyone struggles at first** - Even experienced engineers find some problems hard
2. **Consistency > Intensity** - 2 hours daily beats 14 hours on weekend
3. **Understanding > Speed** - Speed comes with practice
4. **Patterns are key** - Once you know patterns, new problems become familiar
5. **It's a skill** - Like learning an instrument, it takes time

### When Stuck:
1. Don't look at solution immediately (try for 30-45 mins)
2. Look at hints first, not full solution
3. If you look at solution, solve it again next day
4. Solve similar problems to reinforce pattern

### Growth Mindset:
- ‚ùå "I'm not good at algorithms"
- ‚úÖ "I'm not good at algorithms YET"

- ‚ùå "This problem is too hard"
- ‚úÖ "This problem will teach me something new"

- ‚ùå "I'll never get this"
- ‚úÖ "I'll understand this with practice"

**The Journey:**
- Month 1: "This is hard, I don't understand anything"
- Month 2: "I'm starting to see patterns"
- Month 3: "Oh! This is like that other problem"
- Month 4: "I can solve most mediums now"
- Month 5: "I'm getting faster"
- Month 6: "I feel confident for interviews"

**Remember:** Every expert was once a beginner. The only difference is they didn't give up.
