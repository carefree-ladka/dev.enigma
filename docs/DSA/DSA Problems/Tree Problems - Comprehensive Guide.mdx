## Common Patterns & Techniques

### 1. **DFS Templates**

**Recursive DFS (Preorder)**
```python
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Process node
    dfs(node.left)
    dfs(node.right)
```

**Iterative DFS (Using Stack)**
```python
def dfs_iterative(root):
    if not root:
        return
    stack = [root]
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        # Process node
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
```

### 2. **BFS Template**

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            # Process node
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
```

### 3. **BST Search Template**

```python
def search_bst(root, target):
    if not root or root.val == target:
        return root
    if target < root.val:
        return search_bst(root.left, target)
    return search_bst(root.right, target)
```

### 4. **Tree Height/Depth**

```python
def max_depth(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    return 1 + max(max_depth(root.left), max_depth(root.right))
```

### 5. **Path Sum Pattern**

```python
def has_path_sum(root, target):
    if not root:
        return False
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return root.val == target
    target -= root.val
    return has_path_sum(root.left, target) or has_path_sum(root.right, target)
```

### 6. **LCA Pattern**

```python
def lca(root, p, q):
    if not root or root == p or root == q:
        return root
    left = lca(root.left, p, q)
    right = lca(root.right, p, q)
    if left and right:
        return root
    return left or right
```

### 7. **Tree Construction Pattern**

```python
def build_tree(preorder, inorder):
    if not preorder:
        return None
    root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
    mid = inorder.index(root.val)
    root.left = build_tree(preorder[1:mid+1], inorder[:mid])
    root.right = build_tree(preorder[mid+1:], inorder[mid+1:])
    return root
```

## Key Concepts & Tips

### Tree Traversal Summary

| Traversal | Order | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Inorder** | Left → Root → Right | BST sorted order, expression trees |
| **Preorder** | Root → Left → Right | Create copy, prefix notation |
| **Postorder** | Left → Right → Root | Delete tree, postfix notation |
| **Level Order** | Level by level | BFS, shortest path, serialization |

### When to Use Which Traversal

- **Inorder**: BST operations, sorted output
- **Preorder**: Tree copy, serialization, prefix expressions
- **Postorder**: Tree deletion, calculating values, postfix
- **Level Order**: Level-wise operations, shortest path

### BST Properties to Remember

1. **Inorder traversal gives sorted sequence**
2. **Left subtree < Root < Right subtree** (for all nodes)
3. **No duplicate values** (in standard BST)
4. **Search/Insert/Delete in O(log n)** average case
5. **Can degenerate to linked list** in worst case

### Common Edge Cases

1. **Empty tree** (root = null)
2. **Single node tree**
3. **Skewed tree** (all left or all right)
4. **Complete binary tree**
5. **Perfect binary tree**
6. **Nodes with one child**
7. **Duplicate values** (depending on problem)
8. **Negative values**
9. **Very large values** (integer overflow)

### Tree Problem-Solving Checklist

- [ ] Identify if it's BST or general binary tree
- [ ] Choose appropriate traversal (DFS vs BFS)
- [ ] Consider recursive vs iterative approach
- [ ] Handle base cases (null, leaf nodes)
- [ ] Think about space complexity (call stack)
- [ ] Consider edge cases
- [ ] Optimize if needed (Morris traversal for O(1) space)

## Important Algorithms

### 1. **Morris Traversal (Threaded Binary Tree)**
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use**: Inorder/Preorder without recursion or stack
- **Applications**: Space-optimized traversal

### 2. **Floyd's Cycle Detection** (Applied to Trees)
- **Use**: Detect cycles in graphs treated as trees
- **Problems**: Find duplicate number, happy number

### 3. **Tree Diameter Algorithm**
- **Approach**: For each node, calculate max path through it
- **Formula**: max(left_height + right_height + 1)

### 4. **LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)**
- **Binary Tree**: Recursive approach with null checks
- **BST**: Use BST property (compare values)
- **With Parent Pointers**: Similar to linked list intersection

### 5. **Tree Serialization**
- **Preorder with null markers**: Easy reconstruction
- **Level order**: BFS-based serialization
- **BST specific**: Can use preorder only (no null markers)

### 6. **Vertical Order Traversal**
- **Use Hash Map**: Column → nodes mapping
- **Track**: (row, col) coordinates
- **Sort**: By column, then row, then value

### 7. **Tree Construction Algorithms**
- **From Inorder + Preorder**: Root from preorder[0]
- **From Inorder + Postorder**: Root from postorder[-1]
- **Array to BST**: Use middle element as root

## Problem-Solving Strategies

### Strategy 1: Divide and Conquer
**When to use**: Problem can be broken into left and right subtrees

**Examples**:
- Maximum depth
- Balanced tree check
- Diameter calculation

**Pattern**:
```python
def solve(root):
    if not root:
        return base_case
    left_result = solve(root.left)
    right_result = solve(root.right)
    return combine(left_result, right_result, root.val)
```

### Strategy 2: Top-Down DFS (Preorder)
**When to use**: Need to pass information from parent to children

**Examples**:
- Path sum
- Root to leaf paths
- Maximum path from root

**Pattern**:
```python
def solve(root, current_state):
    if not root:
        return
    # Process with current state
    new_state = update(current_state, root.val)
    solve(root.left, new_state)
    solve(root.right, new_state)
```

### Strategy 3: Bottom-Up DFS (Postorder)
**When to use**: Need information from children to process parent

**Examples**:
- Tree height
- Subtree sums
- LCA

**Pattern**:
```python
def solve(root):
    if not root:
        return base_case
    left = solve(root.left)
    right = solve(root.right)
    # Process current node with children's results
    return process(left, right, root.val)
```

### Strategy 4: Level Order BFS
**When to use**: Need to process level by level

**Examples**:
- Level order traversal
- Right side view
- Zigzag traversal

**Pattern**:
```python
def solve(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level = []
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

### Strategy 5: BST In-order for Sorted Processing
**When to use**: Need sorted order in BST

**Examples**:
- Kth smallest element
- Validate BST
- Convert to sorted list

**Pattern**:
```python
def inorder(root, result):
    if not root:
        return
    inorder(root.left, result)
    result.append(root.val)  # Process in sorted order
    inorder(root.right, result)
```

### Strategy 6: Parent Tracking
**When to use**: Need to traverse upward or find ancestors

**Examples**:
- All nodes at distance K
- LCA with parent pointers

**Pattern**:
```python
# Build parent map first
def build_parent_map(root):
    parent = {}
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node.left:
            parent[node.left] = node
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            parent[node.right] = node
            queue.append(node.right)
    return parent
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Path Compression (Tree DP)**
Store results at each node to avoid recomputation

**Example**: House Robber III
```python
def rob(root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return (0, 0)  # (rob, not_rob)
        left = dfs(node.left)
        right = dfs(node.right)
        rob = node.val + left[1] + right[1]
        not_rob = max(left) + max(right)
        return (rob, not_rob)
    return max(dfs(root))
```

### 2. **State Tracking**
Track state information during traversal

**Example**: Binary Tree Cameras
- Track if node is monitored, has camera, or needs monitoring

### 3. **Global Variables for Cross-Node Communication**
Use when comparing across different paths

**Example**: Maximum Path Sum
```python
max_sum = float('-inf')

def max_path_sum(root):
    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal max_sum
        if not node:
            return 0
        left = max(0, dfs(node.left))
        right = max(0, dfs(node.right))
        max_sum = max(max_sum, left + right + node.val)
        return max(left, right) + node.val
    dfs(root)
    return max_sum
```

### 4. **Coordinate System**
Assign coordinates for spatial problems

**Example**: Vertical Order Traversal
- Use (row, col) coordinates
- Hash map: col → list of (row, val)

### 5. **Two-Pass Algorithms**
First pass collects info, second pass processes

**Example**: Sum of Distances in Tree
- First pass: Calculate subtree sizes and initial sums
- Second pass: Adjust sums based on parent's sum

## Interview Tips

### Before Coding

1. **Clarify Problem**
   - Is it binary tree or BST?
   - Can values be negative/duplicate?
   - Is tree balanced?
   - What about empty tree?

2. **Choose Approach**
   - DFS (recursive/iterative) or BFS?
   - Top-down or bottom-up?
   - Need extra space (hash map, parent tracking)?

3. **Discuss Trade-offs**
   - Time vs space complexity
   - Recursive (cleaner) vs iterative (no stack overflow)

### During Coding

1. **Start with Base Cases**
   ```python
   if not root:
       return None/0/[]/False
   ```

2. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Single node
   - Leaf nodes
   - Skewed trees

3. **Use Helper Functions**
   - Separate traversal logic
   - Cleaner code structure

### After Coding

1. **Test with Examples**
   - Empty tree
   - Single node
   - Balanced tree
   - Skewed tree

2. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Time: Usually O(n) for traversal
   - Space: O(h) for recursion, O(n) for BFS

3. **Optimize if Needed**
   - Morris traversal for O(1) space
   - Iterative instead of recursive
   - Early termination

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not handling null nodes** → Always check `if not root`
2. **Confusing node and node.val** → Be careful with references
3. **Wrong base case in recursion** → Think about leaf nodes
4. **Stack overflow in deep trees** → Consider iterative approach
5. **Incorrect BST property** → Remember: left < root < right
6. **Modifying tree during traversal** → Be careful with deletions
7. **Forgetting to return values** → Check all paths return
8. **Off-by-one errors in level order** → Use `len(queue)` correctly
