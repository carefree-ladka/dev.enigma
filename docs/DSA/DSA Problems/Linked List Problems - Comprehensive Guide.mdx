## Common Patterns & Techniques

### 1. **Two Pointer Technique**
- Slow and fast pointer (cycle detection, middle finding)
- Two pointers at different speeds
- Distance-based pointers (remove nth from end)

### 2. **Dummy Head Pattern**
- Use dummy node to simplify edge cases
- Helpful in merge, partition, and deletion problems

### 3. **Reversal Pattern**
```
prev = None
curr = head
while curr:
    next_node = curr.next
    curr.next = prev
    prev = curr
    curr = next_node
```

### 4. **Floyd's Cycle Detection**
- Slow pointer moves 1 step
- Fast pointer moves 2 steps
- If they meet, cycle exists

### 5. **Merge Pattern**
- Use dummy node
- Compare values and link
- Attach remaining nodes

### 6. **Runner Technique**
- One pointer runs ahead
- Useful for middle finding, cycle detection

## Key Tips

### Pointer Management
- Always check for `null` pointers
- Draw diagrams for complex problems
- Use dummy nodes to handle edge cases
- Store next pointer before modifying links

### Common Edge Cases
- Empty list (head = null)
- Single node list
- Two node list
- Odd vs even length lists
- Cycles in the list

### Time Complexity Goals
- Traversal: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: O(1) if position known
- Deletion: O(1) if position known
- Reversal: O(n)
- Sorting: O(n log n) for merge sort

### Space Complexity
- Aim for O(1) space when possible
- Recursive solutions use O(n) stack space
- Consider iterative alternatives

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. Draw the linked list
2. Identify pattern (reversal, two-pointer, etc.)
3. Handle edge cases first
4. Write clean, modular code
5. Test with small examples
6. Optimize if needed

## Essential Templates

### Template 1: Iterative Reversal
```python
def reverse(head):
    prev, curr = None, head
    while curr:
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node
    return prev
```

### Template 2: Two Pointer (Fast/Slow)
```python
def findMiddle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```

### Template 3: Merge Two Lists
```python
def merge(l1, l2):
    dummy = curr = ListNode(0)
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            curr.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            curr.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        curr = curr.next
    curr.next = l1 or l2
    return dummy.next
```

### Template 4: Cycle Detection
```python
def hasCycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```
