# Two Pointers Technique

The **Two Pointers** technique is a popular algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or lists. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure and solve problems efficiently.

## Overview

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set two pointers at specific positions in the data structure, typically at the beginning and end.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Move the pointers towards each other based on certain conditions.
   - Perform operations or checks as needed when pointers meet or cross each other.

3. **Termination**:
   - Continue until the pointers meet or cross, or until a specific condition is satisfied.

## Example Problems

### 1. Finding a Pair with a Given Sum

**Problem**: Given a sorted array, determine if there exists a pair of elements that sum up to a specific target value.

**Solution**: Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and the other at the end of the array. Adjust the pointers based on the sum of the elements they point to.

```javascript
function findPairWithSum(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    const sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [arr[left], arr[right]];
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  return null; // No pair found
}

// Example usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const target = 10;
console.log(findPairWithSum(arr, target)); // Output: [2, 8]
```
