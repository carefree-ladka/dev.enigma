title: Euclidean and Manhattan Distance
---

## Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. For two points (x1, y1) and  (x2, y2), the Euclidean distance is given by the formula:

```JavaScript
Euclidean Distance = sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}
```

### JavaScript Implementation

```JavaScript
function euclideanDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
  return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2));
}

console.log(euclideanDistance(1, 2, 4, 6)); // Output: 5
```

## Manhattan Distance

Manhattan distance, also known as "taxicab" or "city block" distance, is the distance between two points measured along the axes at right angles. For two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), the Manhattan distance is given by:

```JavaScript
Manhattan Distance = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|
```

### JavaScript Implementation

```JavaScript
function manhattanDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
  return Math.abs(x2 - x1) + Math.abs(y2 - y1);
}

console.log(manhattanDistance(1, 2, 4, 6)); // Output: 7
```

## Use Cases

- **Euclidean Distance** is often used in geometric problems, clustering algorithms (like k-means), and when calculating the shortest distance between two points.
- **Manhattan Distance** is useful when movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions, such as grid-based systems or city road networks.
