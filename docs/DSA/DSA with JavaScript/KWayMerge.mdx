# K-Way Merge Pattern

The **k-way merge** pattern is a technique used to merge `k` sorted arrays (or linked lists) into a single sorted array. It's commonly used in problems like merging multiple sorted arrays, finding the smallest range covering elements from `k` lists, and more.

## Problem Statement

Given `k` sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array.

## Approach

1. **Min-Heap:** We use a min-heap (or priority queue) to efficiently fetch the smallest element among the `k` arrays.
2. **Initialization:** Insert the first element of each array into the heap.
3. **Merging:** Repeatedly extract the smallest element from the heap and add the next element from the same array to the heap until all elements are merged.

### Example

Let's consider an example with `k = 3` arrays:

```JavaScript
const arrays = [
  [1, 4, 5],
  [1, 3, 4],
  [2, 6]
];
```
We want to merge these arrays into a single sorted array.

### Steps

1. **Insert First Elements:** Start by inserting the first element from each array into the heap:
   - Heap: `[1, 1, 2]`
2. **Extract Min:** Extract `1` (smallest element) from the heap and insert the next element from the same array:
   - Heap: `[1, 2, 4]`
3. **Repeat:** Continue this process until all elements are merged.

### Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s a sample implementation in JavaScript:

```JavaScript
function mergeKSortedArrays(arrays) {
  const minHeap = new MinHeap();
  const result = [];

  // Initialize the heap with the first element of each array
  for (let i = 0; i < arrays.length; i++) {
    if (arrays[i].length > 0) {
      minHeap.enequeue(arrays[i][0], i, 0);
    }
  }

  while (minHeap.heap.length > 0) {
    const { val, arrIndex, valIndex } = minHeap.dequeue();
    result.push(val);
    // If the array has more elements, add the next element to the heap
    if (valIndex + 1 < arrays[arrIndex].length) {
      minHeap.enequeue(arrays[arrIndex][valIndex + 1], arrIndex, valIndex + 1);
    }
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage
const arrays = [
  [1, 4, 5],
  [1, 3, 4],
  [2, 6]
];
const result = mergeKSortedArrays(arrays);
console.log(result); // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where `N` is the total number of elements across all arrays and `k` is the number of arrays.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k) for storing elements in the heap.

### Use Cases

- Merging multiple log files.
- Finding the smallest range covering elements from `k` sorted lists.
- K-way merge in external sorting.

## Conclusion

The k-way merge pattern is a powerful technique for efficiently merging multiple sorted arrays. It leverages a min-heap to always extract the smallest element, ensuring that the resulting array is sorted.
