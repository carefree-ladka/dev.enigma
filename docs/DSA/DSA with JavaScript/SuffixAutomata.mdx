# Suffix Automaton

A Suffix Automaton is a state machine that represents all substrings of a given string efficiently. It's used primarily in string processing problems, such as substring matching, pattern matching, and finding repeated substrings, among others. It builds a minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to recognize all the suffixes of a string.

## Key Concepts

**1. State:** Each state in a suffix automaton represents a set of substrings that can be recognized from that state.

**2. Transition:** A transition between two states is labeled with a character, and it represents moving from one state to another when that character is read.

**3. Minimality:** The suffix automaton is built to minimize the number of states while still representing all suffixes of the string.

**4. Suffix Link:** A suffix link is a special kind of transition that allows you to move from a state to another state that represents a "shorter" suffix of the string. This link plays a crucial role in efficiently constructing and using suffix automata.

## Properties

**Number of States:** For a string of length n, a suffix automaton has at most 2n - 1 states.

**Time Complexity:** Constructing a suffix automaton takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the string.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) in terms of the number of states and transitions.

## Construction

A suffix automaton can be constructed by iteratively adding characters from the string and adjusting the automaton as follows:

**Start State:** Initially, thereâ€™s one state, representing the empty string.

**Adding Characters:** For each character of the string, add a new state and connect it to the current state with a transition labeled by the character.

**Suffix Links:** As new states are added, suffix links are used to connect states that represent similar suffixes.

## Suffix Automaton Implementation

```JavaScript
class State {
  length = 0;  // Length of the longest string in this state
  transitions = new Map();  // Transitions to other states
  link = null;  // Suffix link
  endpos = -1;  // Position where this state ends
}


class SuffixAutomaton {
  states = Array.of(new State());
  last = 0;  // Index of last state
  size = 1;  // Total number of states


  // Add a character to the automaton
  addChar(c) {
    let curr = this.size++;
    this.states[curr] = new State();
    this.states[curr].length = this.states[this.last].length + 1;
    this.states[curr].endpos = this.states[curr].length - 1;

    // Add transitions from previous states
    let p = this.last;
    while (p !== null && !this.states[p].transitions.has(c)) {
      this.states[p].transitions.set(c, curr);
      p = this.states[p].link;
    }

    if (p === null) {
      this.states[curr].link = 0;
    } else {
      let q = this.states[p].transitions.get(c);
      if (this.states[p].length + 1 === this.states[q].length) {
        this.states[curr].link = q;
      } else {
        // Clone state q
        let clone = this.size++;
        this.states[clone] = new State();
        this.states[clone].length = this.states[p].length + 1;
        this.states[clone].transitions = new Map(this.states[q].transitions);
        this.states[clone].link = this.states[q].link;

        while (p !== null && this.states[p].transitions.get(c) === q) {
          this.states[p].transitions.set(c, clone);
          p = this.states[p].link;
        }

        this.states[q].link = this.states[curr].link = clone;
      }
    }
    this.last = curr;
  }

  // Build automaton from string
  build(str) {
    for (let char of str) {
      this.addChar(char);
    }
  }

  // Check if a string is a substring
  contains(str) {
    let state = 0;
    for (let char of str) {
      if (!this.states[state].transitions.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      state = this.states[state].transitions.get(char);
    }
    return true;
  }
}


const sa = new SuffixAutomaton();
sa.build("banana");

console.log(sa.contains("ana")); // true
console.log(sa.contains("nan")); // true
console.log(sa.contains("ban")); // true
console.log(sa.contains("xyz")); // false
console.log(sa.contains("baa")); // false
```
