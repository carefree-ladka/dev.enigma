title: Kruskal's Algorithm
---


Kruskal's algorithm is a popular algorithm in graph theory for finding the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, weighted, undirected graph. The MST connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight and without any cycles.

## Steps of Kruskal's Algorithm

1. **Sort all edges** in the graph in ascending order based on their weight.
2. Initialize a disjoint - set(union - find) structure, where each vertex starts in its own set.
3. Iterate through the sorted edges:
- For each edge, check if the vertices it connects belong to different sets(using the union - find structure).
   - If they are in different sets, add the edge to the MST and unite the sets to avoid cycles.
4. **Repeat step 3** until there are exactly `V-1` edges in the MST, where`V` is the number of vertices.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the edges takes O(ElogE).
- Union - find operations(with path compression and union by rank) have nearly constant time complexity,O(E*logV).
  
The overall time complexity is O(ElogE) or O(Elog V), where``E`` is the number of edges and ``V`` is the number of vertices.

## JavaScript Implementation

Below is a JavaScript implementation of Kruskal's algorithm:

  ```JavaScript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(n) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(n).fill(0);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);  // Path compression
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        const rootX = this.find(x);
        const rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            // Union by rank
            if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
                this.rank[rootX]++;
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

function kruskal(n, edges) {
    edges.sort((a, b) => a[2] - b[2]);  // Sort edges by weight
    const uf = new UnionFind(n);
    const mst = [];

    for (const [u, v, weight] of edges) {
        if (uf.union(u, v)) {
            mst.push([u, v, weight]);
            if (mst.length === n - 1) break;  // MST has n-1 edges
        }
    }
    return mst;
}

// Example usage
const n = 4;  // Number of vertices
const edges = [
    [0, 1, 10],
    [0, 2, 6],
    [0, 3, 5],
    [1, 3, 15],
    [2, 3, 4]
];

console.log(kruskal(n, edges));//[ [ 2, 3, 4 ], [ 0, 3, 5 ], [ 0, 1, 10 ] ]
```
