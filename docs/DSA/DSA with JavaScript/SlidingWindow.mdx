## Sliding Window Technique

The Sliding Window technique is a powerful approach used to solve problems involving sequences, substrings, or subarrays efficiently. It optimizes the process of examining or modifying contiguous segments of an array or string by maintaining a window of fixed or variable size that "slides" across the data.

### Problem Statement

The Sliding Window technique is commonly applied to problems where you need to find the maximum, minimum, or other aggregated value of a contiguous segment within an array or string, or where you need to identify specific patterns or conditions.

### Types of Sliding Window Techniques

1. **Fixed-Size Window**: The window has a constant size and moves through the data. Useful for problems like finding the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.

2. **Variable-Size Window**: The window size is adjusted dynamically based on certain conditions. Useful for problems like finding the smallest substring containing all characters of a given set.

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Initialization**: Set up pointers or indices to represent the current window.
2. **Expand Window**: Extend the window by moving the end pointer or index.
3. **Contract Window**: Shrink the window by moving the start pointer or index when necessary.
4. **Update Result**: Perform calculations or checks within the window to maintain or update the result.

### Fixed-Size Window Example

Find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k` in a given array:

```javascript
/**
 * Find the maximum sum of any subarray of size k.
 * @param {number[]} arr - The input array.
 * @param {number} k - The size of the subarray.
 * @return {number} - The maximum sum of any subarray of size k.
 */
const maxSumSubarray = (arr, k) => {
  let maxSum = 0;
  let windowSum = 0;

  // Compute the sum of the first window
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    windowSum += arr[i];
  }
  maxSum = windowSum;

  // Slide the window across the array
  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
};
```

### Other Variations to Write Sliding Window

```JavaScript
const maxSumSubarray = (nums = [], k) => {
  let max = -Infinity
  let sum = 0
  let left = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    sum += nums[i]

    if (i + left - 1 === k) {
      max = Math.max(max, sum)
      sum -= nums[left++]
    }
  }

  return max
}
```

```JavaScript
const maxSumSubarray = (arr, k) => {
  let maxSum = 0;
  let windowSum = 0;

  // Slide the window from start to end
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum += arr[i]
    if (i >= k - 1) {
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
      windowSum -= arr[i - k + 1]
    }
  }

  return maxSum;
}
```

### Variable-Size Window Example

```JavaScript
/**
 * Find the maximum sum of any subarray with length between minLen and maxLen.
 * @param {number[]} arr - The input array.
 * @param {number} minLen - Minimum length of the subarray.
 * @param {number} maxLen - Maximum length of the subarray.
 * @return {number} - The maximum sum of any valid subarray.
 */
const maxSumSubarrayVariableSize = (arr, minLen, maxLen) => {
  let start = 0;
  let end = 0;
  let currentSum = 0;
  let maxSum = -Infinity;

  while (end < arr.length) {
    // Expand the window by including arr[end]
    currentSum += arr[end];

    // Ensure the window size is within the specified range
    if (end - start + 1 > maxLen) {
      currentSum -= arr[start];
      start++;
    }

    // Update maxSum if the current window size is within the range
    if (end - start + 1 >= minLen) {
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }

    // Move the end pointer to expand the window
    end++;
  }

  return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
const minLen = 2;
const maxLen = 4;

console.log(maxSumSubarrayVariableSize(arr, minLen, maxLen)); // Output: 22

```
