# Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm

The **Fisher-Yates Shuffle** algorithm is an efficient method for randomly shuffling a finite sequence of items. It ensures that each permutation of the sequence is equally likely.

## Overview

The Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm iterates through the sequence from the end to the beginning, swapping each element with a randomly chosen element that comes before it (including itself). This ensures that all permutations of the sequence are equally probable.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the last element of the sequence.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element, generate a random index from the current position to the beginning of the sequence.
   - Swap the current element with the element at the random index.

3. **Termination**:
   - Continue until you have processed the entire sequence.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of items in the sequence. This is because each element is swapped exactly once.

## JavaScript Implementation

Here is a simple JavaScript implementation of the Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm:

```javascript
function fisherYatesShuffle(array) {
  let m = array.length;
  
  // While there remain elements to shuffle
  while (m > 1) {
    // Pick a remaining element
    const i = Math.floor(Math.random() * m--);
    
    // Swap it with the current element
    [array[m], array[i]] = [array[i], array[m]];
  }
  
  return array;
}

// Example usage
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const shuffledArray = fisherYatesShuffle(array);
console.log(shuffledArray); // Output: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2] (random order)
```
