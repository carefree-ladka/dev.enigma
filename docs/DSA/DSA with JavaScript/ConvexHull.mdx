# Graham's Scan Algorithm & Convex Hull

## Theory

A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can contain all points in a given set. Think of it as wrapping a rubber band around all the points - the shape it forms is the convex hull.

### Key Concepts

1. **Convex Polygon**: A polygon where:
   - All interior angles are less than 180 degrees
   - Any line segment between two points inside the polygon lies entirely inside the polygon

2. **Properties**:
   - Every point in the set is either inside the hull or on its boundary
   - The hull vertices are a subset of the original points
   - The hull is unique for a given set of points

### Graham's Scan Algorithm Steps

1. **Find Anchor Point**
   - Select the point with lowest y-coordinate (leftmost point if tie)
   - This point is guaranteed to be on the hull

2. **Sort Points**
   - Sort remaining points by polar angle relative to anchor point
   - If angles are equal, sort by distance from anchor

3. **Build Hull**
   - Push first three points onto stack
   - For each remaining point:
     - While the last three points make a non-left turn, pop the middle point
     - Push current point

4. **Handle Collinear Points**
   - Special care needed when multiple points have same angle
   - Include all collinear points in final hull

## Implementation

```JavaScript
class Point {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}

// Compute cross product to determine orientation
const crossProduct = (p, q, r) => (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x);

// Compute squared distance between two points
const distSq = (p1, p2) => (p1.x - p2.x) ** 2 + (p1.y - p2.y) ** 2;

// Graham's Scan algorithm
const convexHull = (points) => {
  if (points.length < 3) return points;

  // Find pivot (lowest y, then lowest x if tie)
  const pivot = points.reduce((a, b) => (b.y < a.y || (b.y === a.y && b.x < a.x) ? b : a));

  // Sort by polar angle (remove collinear points)
  points.sort((a, b) => {
    let order = crossProduct(pivot, a, b);
    return order === 0 ? distSq(pivot, a) - distSq(pivot, b) : -order;
  });

  // Construct hull using stack
  return points.reduce((hull, p) => {
    while (hull.length > 1 && crossProduct(hull[hull.length - 2], hull[hull.length - 1], p) <= 0) {
      hull.pop();
    }
    hull.push(p);
    return hull;
  }, []);
};

// Example usage
const points = [
  new Point(0, 3), new Point(1, 1), new Point(2, 2),
  new Point(4, 4), new Point(0, 0), new Point(1, 2),
  new Point(3, 1), new Point(3, 3)
];

const convexHullPoints = convexHull(points);
console.log("Convex Hull Points:", convexHullPoints.map(p => `(${p.x}, ${p.y})`));
```

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  - Sorting points takes O(n log n)
  - Building hull takes O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Stack storage
  - Sorted array storage

## LeetCode Problems Using Convex Hull

1. **587. Erect the Fence** (Hard)
   - Direct application of convex hull
   - Need to handle collinear points carefully

2. **1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost** (Medium)
   - Can be optimized using convex hull concept
   - Dynamic programming with geometric properties

3. **483. Smallest Good Base** (Hard)
   - While not directly using convex hull, uses similar geometric concepts
   - Binary search with geometric properties

4. **456. 132 Pattern** (Medium)
   - Can be solved using monotonic stack (similar principle to Graham's Scan)
   - Stack maintenance similar to convex hull building

## Common Variations & Extensions

1. **Monotone Chain Algorithm**
   - Alternative to Graham's Scan
   - Builds upper and lower hulls separately
   - Often simpler to implement

2. **Dynamic Convex Hull**
   - Maintain hull as points are added/removed
   - More complex but useful for streaming data

3. **Closest Pair of Points**
   - Can be solved using convex hull techniques
   - Often combined with divide-and-conquer

## Tips for Implementation

1. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Less than 3 points
   - Collinear points
   - Duplicate points

2. **Numerical Precision**
   - Use appropriate epsilon for floating-point comparisons
   - Consider integer-only implementations when possible

3. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Pre-compute angles/distances
   - Use array instead of stack for better cache performance
   - Consider removing redundant calculations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not handling collinear points correctly
2. Incorrect anchor point selection
3. Wrong turn detection implementation
4. Not handling edge cases
5. Poor floating-point comparisons
