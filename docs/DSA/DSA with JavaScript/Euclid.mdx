## Euclid's Algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Euclid's Algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Euclid's Algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

### Concept

Euclid's Algorithm uses the following principle:

- The GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and `a % b`, where `%` denotes the modulus operation.

This process is repeated until one of the numbers becomes zero. At that point, the non-zero number is the GCD.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initial Step**: Given two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. **Modulo Operation**: Compute the remainder `r` when `a` is divided by `b` (i.e., `r = a % b`).
3. **Update Numbers**: Replace `a` with `b` and `b` with `r`.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until `b` becomes zero.
5. **Result**: The GCD is the non-zero number.

### Code Example

**JavaScript Implementation**:

```javascript
/**
 * Compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using Euclid's Algorithm.
 * @param {number} a - The first integer.
 * @param {number} b - The second integer.
 * @return {number} - The GCD of the two integers.
 */
const gcd = (a, b) => {
  while (b !== 0) {
    const temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
};
```
