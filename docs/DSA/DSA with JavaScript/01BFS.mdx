## 0-1 BFS Algorithm

0-1 BFS is a specialized version of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm designed to handle graphs where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently finds the shortest path in such graphs by leveraging a double-ended queue (deque) to maintain a more nuanced approach to edge weights.

### Concept

In 0-1 BFS:
- **Edge Weights**: The edge weights are either 0 or 1.
- **Data Structure**: A double-ended queue (deque) is used to optimize the traversal. Nodes connected by an edge with weight 0 are added to the front of the deque, and nodes connected by an edge with weight 1 are added to the back.
- **Objective**: To find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Start by initializing the distance for each node as infinity, except for the source node which is set to 0. Use a deque to manage the nodes to be processed.
2. **Process Nodes**: Dequeue nodes and update their neighbors based on edge weights.
   - For an edge with weight 0, update the neighbor’s distance and add it to the front of the deque.
   - For an edge with weight 1, update the neighbor’s distance and add it to the back of the deque.
3. **Continue**: Repeat the process until all nodes are processed.

### Code Example

**JavaScript Implementation**:

```javascript
const { Deque } = require('collections/deque');

/**
 * Compute the shortest path distances from the source node using 0-1 BFS.
 * @param {number[][]} graph - Adjacency list representation of the graph with edge weights 0 or 1.
 * @param {number} source - The source node.
 * @return {number[]} - Array of shortest path distances from the source.
 */
const zeroOneBFS = (graph, source) => {
  const n = graph.length;
  const distances = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
  const deque = new Deque();

  distances[source] = 0;
  deque.pushFront(source);

  while (deque.length > 0) {
    const node = deque.shift();
    
    for (const [neighbor, weight] of graph[node]) {
      const newDist = distances[node] + weight;
      if (newDist < distances[neighbor]) {
        distances[neighbor] = newDist;
        if (weight === 0) {
          deque.pushFront(neighbor);
        } else {
          deque.pushBack(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return distances;
};
```
