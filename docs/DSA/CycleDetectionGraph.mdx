title: Cycle Detection in Graphs
---

Cycle detection is an essential aspect of graph theory, used to identify whether a graph contains cycles. This document outlines methods for detecting cycles in both directed and undirected graphs.

### Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs
    1. DFS
    2. BFS
    3. Kahn's Algorithm (Topological Sorting)

Kahn's Algorithm is a method used to detect cycles in directed graphs by attempting to find a topological ordering. If a topological order exists, the graph is acyclic; otherwise, it contains at least one cycle. 

## Steps of Kahn's Algorithm

1. **Compute In-Degree**: Calculate the in-degree (the number of incoming edges) for each vertex in the graph.
2. **Initialize the Queue**: Enqueue all vertices with an in-degree of 0 (vertices with no incoming edges).
3. **Process the Queue**:
   - Dequeue a vertex and increment a counter for visited nodes.
   - For each neighboring vertex, decrease its in-degree. If a neighbor’s in-degree becomes 0, enqueue it.
4. **Cycle Check**: After processing, if the count of visited nodes is not equal to the total number of vertices, a cycle exists.

```JavaScript
function kahnCycleDetection(graph) {
    // Step 1: Compute in-degrees of all vertices
    const inDegree = new Array(graph.length).fill(0);
    
    for (let u = 0; u < graph.length; u++) {
        for (const v of graph[u]) {
            inDegree[v]++;
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Initialize the queue with all vertices having in-degree 0
    const queue = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < inDegree.length; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Count of visited nodes
    let visitedCount = 0;

    // Step 4: Process the queue
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        // Dequeue a vertex
        const current = queue.shift();
        visitedCount++; // Increment count of visited nodes

        // Step 5: Decrease the in-degree of neighboring nodes
        for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            // If in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue
            if (inDegree[neighbor] === 0) {
                queue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 6: If the visited count is not equal to the number of nodes, a cycle exists
    return visitedCount !== graph.length; // Returns true if a cycle is detected
}

// Example usage:
const directedGraph = [
    [1],    // 0 -> 1
    [2],    // 1 -> 2
    [0],    // 2 -> 0 (cycle)
    []
];

console.log("Cycle Detected:", kahnCycleDetection(directedGraph));
```

Kahn's Algorithm is an efficient method for detecting cycles in directed graphs, with a time complexity of O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. 


### Cycle Detection in Undirected Graphs
    1. DFS
    2. BFS
    3. Union Find (Disjoint Set)
    4. Graph coloring

### Union-Find (Disjoint Set) for Cycle Detection in Undirected Graphs

1. **Initialize**: Create a Union-Find structure to keep track of the components.
2. **Process Edges**: For each edge in the graph:
   - Use the **Find** operation to check if the two vertices of the edge belong to the same set.
   - If they do, a cycle exists.
   - If they don’t, use the **Union** operation to merge their sets.
3. **Conclusion**: If no cycles are detected during the process, the graph is acyclic.

```JavaScript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
    }

    find(node) {
        if (this.parent[node] !== node) {
            // Path compression
            this.parent[node] = this.find(this.parent[node]);
        }
        return this.parent[node];
    }

    union(node1, node2) {
        const root1 = this.find(node1);
        const root2 = this.find(node2);

        if (root1 === root2) {
            return false; // A cycle is detected
        }

        // Union by rank
        if (this.rank[root1] > this.rank[root2]) {
            this.parent[root2] = root1;
        } else if (this.rank[root1] < this.rank[root2]) {
            this.parent[root1] = root2;
        } else {
            this.parent[root2] = root1;
            this.rank[root1]++;
        }
        return true; // No cycle detected
    }
}

function hasCycle(graph) {
    const uf = new UnionFind(graph.length);

    for (const [u, v] of graph) {
        if (!uf.union(u, v)) {
            return true; // Cycle detected
        }
    }

    return false; // No cycle detected
}

// Example usage:
const undirectedGraph = [
    [0, 1],
    [1, 2],
    [2, 0], // This edge creates a cycle
    [1, 3]
];

console.log("Cycle Detected:", hasCycle(undirectedGraph));
```
``Time Complexity:``
- Find : O(α(n))
- Union: O(α(n))
- Total for m operations:O(m⋅α(n))
- Here, α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly. For all practical purposes, it can be considered constant, making the Find operation nearly O(1)

``Space Complexity`` : O(n)
