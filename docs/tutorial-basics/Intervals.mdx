## Interval Problems

Interval problems are common in algorithmic challenges, dealing with ranges or intervals and often requiring merging, overlapping, or processing intervals in various ways. This document covers fundamental problems related to intervals, including the Merge Intervals problem.

### Utility Methods for interval problems

```JavaScript
/**
 * Check if two intervals overlap.
 * @param {number[]} interval1 - The first interval as [start, end].
 * @param {number[]} interval2 - The second interval as [start, end].
 * @return {boolean} - True if the intervals overlap, otherwise false.
 */
const isOverlapping = (interval1, interval2) => {
  return interval1[0] <= interval2[1] && interval2[0] <= interval1[1];
};

/**
 * Merge two overlapping intervals.
 * @param {number[]} interval1 - The first interval as [start, end].
 * @param {number[]} interval2 - The second interval as [start, end].
 * @return {number[]} - The merged interval as [start, end].
 */
const mergeIntervals = (interval1, interval2) => {
  if (!isOverlapping(interval1, interval2)) {
    throw new Error('Intervals do not overlap.');
  }
  return [Math.min(interval1[0], interval2[0]), Math.max(interval1[1], interval2[1])];
};

/**
 * Find all overlapping intervals with a given interval from a list of intervals.
 * @param {number[][]} intervals - A list of intervals, each represented as [start, end].
 * @param {number[]} interval - The interval to check for overlaps.
 * @return {number[][]} - A list of overlapping intervals.
 */
const findOverlappingIntervals = (intervals, interval) => {
  return intervals.filter(otherInterval => isOverlapping(otherInterval, interval));
};

// Example usage:

// Define some intervals
const interval1 = [1, 5];
const interval2 = [4, 8];
const interval3 = [10, 15];
const intervalToFind = [3, 6];
const intervalsList = [[1, 5], [6, 10], [15, 20]];

// Check if intervals overlap
console.log(isOverlapping(interval1, interval2)); // Output: true
console.log(isOverlapping(interval1, interval3)); // Output: false

// Merge overlapping intervals
console.log(mergeIntervals(interval1, interval2)); // Output: [1, 8]

// Find overlapping intervals
console.log(findOverlappingIntervals(intervalsList, intervalToFind)); // Output: [[1, 5]]

```


### Merge Intervals

**Problem Statement**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.


**Example**:
```javascript
/**
 * Merge overlapping intervals.
 * @param {number[][]} intervals - A list of intervals where each interval is represented as [start, end].
 * @return {number[][]} - The merged list of intervals.
 */
const mergeIntervals = (intervals) => {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return [];

  // Sort intervals by their starting point
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  const merged = [intervals[0]];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const current = intervals[i];
    const lastMerged = merged[merged.length - 1];

    if (current[0] <= lastMerged[1]) {
      // Overlapping intervals, merge them
      lastMerged[1] = Math.max(lastMerged[1], current[1]);
    } else {
      // No overlap, add the current interval
      merged.push(current);
    }
  }

  return merged;
}

// Example usage:
const intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]];
console.log(mergeIntervals(intervals)); 
// Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```



### Insert Interval

```JavaScript
var insert = function (intervals, newInterval) {
  const result = [];
  let i = 0;
  const n = intervals.length;

  // Add all intervals that come before the new interval
  while (i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
    result.push(intervals[i++]);
  }

  // Merge all overlapping intervals with the new interval
  while (i < n && isOverlapping(intervals[i], newInterval)) {
    newInterval = merge(intervals[i++], newInterval);
  }
  result.push(newInterval);

  // Add all intervals that come after the new interval
  while (i < n) {
    result.push(intervals[i++]);
  }

  return result;
};
```
