## Easy Questions

### 1. What is Java?
**Answer:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It follows the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### 2. What are the main features of Java?
**Answer:**
- Platform independence
- Object-oriented programming
- Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection)
- Multithreading support
- Security
- Robustness
- Simple syntax

### 3. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
**Answer:**
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Runtime environment that executes Java bytecode
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** JVM + libraries needed to run Java applications
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.)

### 4. What are the primitive data types in Java?
**Answer:** 8 primitive types:
- `byte` (1 byte)
- `short` (2 bytes)
- `int` (4 bytes)
- `long` (8 bytes)
- `float` (4 bytes)
- `double` (8 bytes)
- `char` (2 bytes)
- `boolean` (1 bit)

### 5. What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` method?
**Answer:**
- `==` compares references (memory addresses) for objects, values for primitives
- `equals()` compares the actual content/value of objects (when properly overridden)

### 6. What is method overloading?
**Answer:** Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number, type, or order of parameters) within the same class.

### 7. What is the `static` keyword?
**Answer:** `static` means the member belongs to the class rather than any instance. Static members can be accessed without creating an object of the class.

### 8. What is inheritance in Java?
**Answer:** Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass) using the `extends` keyword.

### 9. What is polymorphism?
**Answer:** Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. It includes method overriding (runtime) and method overloading (compile-time).

### 10. What is encapsulation?
**Answer:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while hiding the internal implementation details.

## Medium Questions

### 1. What is the difference between abstract class and interface?
**Answer:**
- **Abstract Class:** Can have both abstract and concrete methods, constructors, instance variables, access modifiers
- **Interface:** Only abstract methods (before Java 8), public by default, no constructors, only static final variables

### 2. What are the access modifiers in Java?
**Answer:**
- `private`: Accessible only within the same class
- `default` (package-private): Accessible within the same package
- `protected`: Accessible within package and subclasses
- `public`: Accessible everywhere

### 3. What is exception handling in Java?
**Answer:** Exception handling uses try-catch-finally blocks to handle runtime errors gracefully:
```java
try {
    // risky code
} catch (SpecificException e) {
    // handle exception
} finally {
    // cleanup code
}
```

### 4. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
**Answer:**
- **Checked Exceptions:** Must be handled at compile time (IOException, SQLException)
- **Unchecked Exceptions:** Runtime exceptions that don't need explicit handling (NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)

### 5. What is multithreading and how do you create threads?
**Answer:** Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads. Two ways to create threads:
1. Extend `Thread` class
2. Implement `Runnable` interface

### 6. What is synchronization in Java?
**Answer:** Synchronization prevents thread interference and memory consistency errors by allowing only one thread to access a shared resource at a time using `synchronized` keyword.

### 7. What are Collections in Java?
**Answer:** Collections Framework provides data structures like List, Set, Map, and Queue with implementations like ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.

### 8. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
**Answer:**
- **ArrayList:** Dynamic array, fast random access, slower insertion/deletion
- **LinkedList:** Doubly linked list, slower random access, faster insertion/deletion

### 9. What is garbage collection?
**Answer:** Automatic memory management that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced, preventing memory leaks.

### 10. What is the `finalize()` method?
**Answer:** A method called by garbage collector before destroying an object. Used for cleanup operations but not recommended due to unpredictable timing.

### 11. What is method overriding?
**Answer:** Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. Uses `@Override` annotation and follows runtime polymorphism.

### 12. What is the `super` keyword?
**Answer:** `super` refers to the immediate parent class object. Used to access parent class methods, constructors, and variables.

## Hard Questions

### 1. Explain the Java Memory Model and different memory areas
**Answer:** Java memory is divided into:
- **Heap:** Objects and instance variables (Young Generation, Old Generation)
- **Stack:** Method calls and local variables
- **Method Area:** Class-level data, static variables, method bytecode
- **PC Register:** Current executing instruction
- **Native Method Stack:** Native method calls

### 2. What are the different types of classloaders?
**Answer:**
- **Bootstrap ClassLoader:** Loads core Java classes from rt.jar
- **Extension ClassLoader:** Loads classes from ext directory
- **Application ClassLoader:** Loads classes from classpath
- **Custom ClassLoaders:** User-defined loaders

### 3. Explain the concept of immutable objects and how to create them
**Answer:** Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation. To create:
- Make class `final`
- Make all fields `private final`
- Don't provide setter methods
- Initialize all fields via constructor
- Return defensive copies of mutable objects

### 4. What is reflection and when would you use it?
**Answer:** Reflection allows runtime inspection and manipulation of classes, methods, and fields. Used in frameworks, serialization, testing frameworks, and dependency injection.

### 5. Explain different types of nested classes
**Answer:**
- **Static Nested Class:** Can be instantiated without outer class instance
- **Inner Class:** Requires outer class instance, has access to outer class members
- **Local Class:** Defined inside a method
- **Anonymous Class:** Unnamed class, typically used with interfaces

### 6. What are generics and type erasure?
**Answer:** Generics provide type safety at compile time. Type erasure removes generic type information at runtime for backward compatibility, replacing with raw types or bounds.

### 7. Explain the producer-consumer problem and its solution
**Answer:** Classic synchronization problem where producers generate data and consumers process it. Solutions include:
- `wait()` and `notify()`
- `BlockingQueue`
- `Semaphore`
- `ReentrantLock` with `Condition`

### 8. What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
**Answer:**
- **Fail-fast:** Throws `ConcurrentModificationException` if collection is modified during iteration (ArrayList)
- **Fail-safe:** Creates a copy and iterates over it, allowing safe modification (ConcurrentHashMap)

### 9. Explain different garbage collection algorithms
**Answer:**
- **Serial GC:** Single-threaded, suitable for small applications
- **Parallel GC:** Multi-threaded, default for server applications
- **G1 GC:** Low-latency collector for large heaps
- **ZGC/Shenandoah:** Ultra-low latency collectors

### 10. What is the happens-before relationship?
**Answer:** Defines ordering constraints between memory operations in concurrent programming. Ensures that certain operations are visible to other threads in a specific order.

### 11. Explain the Singleton pattern and its thread-safe implementations
**Answer:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists. Thread-safe implementations:
- Synchronized method
- Double-checked locking
- Enum singleton
- Static inner class (Bill Pugh)

### 12. What are weak, soft, and phantom references?
**Answer:**
- **Strong Reference:** Normal references, prevent GC
- **Weak Reference:** Eligible for GC even if referenced
- **Soft Reference:** GC only when memory is low
- **Phantom Reference:** Used for cleanup actions, already GC'd objects

### 13. Explain the Fork/Join framework
**Answer:** Parallel computing framework that uses work-stealing algorithm. Tasks are recursively split into smaller subtasks and executed in parallel using `ForkJoinPool`.

### 14. What is the difference between `Callable` and `Runnable`?
**Answer:**
- **Runnable:** `run()` method, returns void, cannot throw checked exceptions
- **Callable:** `call()` method, returns a value, can throw checked exceptions

### 15. Explain Java 8+ features (Lambda, Streams, Optional)
**Answer:**
- **Lambda Expressions:** Anonymous functions for functional programming
- **Streams API:** Functional-style operations on collections
- **Optional:** Container to avoid null pointer exceptions
- **Method References:** Shorthand for lambda expressions
