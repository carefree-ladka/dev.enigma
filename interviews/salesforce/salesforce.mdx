# Frontend Developer Interview Experience

**Role:** Frontend Developer
**Location:** Hyderabad
**Experience:** 4+ years
**Date:** September 2024

## Online Assessment (Hackerrank)

The assessment consisted of two coding questions with a clear difficulty gradient.

### Question 1

Moderate difficulty problem that I was able to solve completely. The problem was approachable and required solid problem-solving fundamentals.

### Question 2: Minimize Malware Spread

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Problem:** [LeetCode 928 - Minimize Malware Spread](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-malware-spread/description/)

I attempted a DFS solution but only passed 11 out of 15 test cases. The optimal approach uses BFS or Union Find for better performance.

**Interesting note:** I had seen this exact problem the day before but didn't solve it. A reminder that consistent practice pays off!

**Result:** Moved to onsite rounds

## Onsite Interview Rounds

All rounds were conducted on the same day as part of a hiring event on September 20th.

### Round 1: DSA & Web Fundamentals (Passed)

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**

- [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)
- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Successfully explained approaches and coded complete solutions for both problems.

**Frontend Concepts Covered:**

- JavaScript implementation of debounce function
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layout systems
- Axios vs Fetch API differences
- HTML5 semantic elements
- Modern JavaScript features

**Outcome:** Performed well, explained everything clearly

### Round 2: Advanced JavaScript & Graph Algorithms

**Question 1:** Promise-based JavaScript problem
Deep dive into async/await, promise chaining, and error handling patterns.

**Question 2:** Connected Components with Maximum Difference

**Problem Statement:**
Given a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, calculate the difference between maximum and minimum numbered nodes in each connected component, then return the maximum difference across all components.

**Input Format:**

- First line: `n` (nodes) and `m` (edges)
- Next `m` lines: pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing edges

**Example:**

```
Input:
6 4
1 3
3 5
5 2
2 4

Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**

- Component 1: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` → max(5) - min(1) = 4
- Component 2: {6} → max(6) - min(6) = 0
- Maximum difference = 4

**Outcome:** Did well overall

### Round 3: Deep Frontend & System Design (2 hours)

This was the most challenging round and mentally exhausting.

**JavaScript Quirks & Edge Cases:**

- Tricky JavaScript behavior questions
- Hoisting, closures, and scope edge cases
- Type coercion scenarios

**HTML & CSS Advanced Topics:**

- CSS3 advanced features and tricky properties
- Modern CSS techniques
- Layout challenges

**Browser Internals:**

- Critical Rendering Path (CRP)
- Render Tree construction
- HTML/CSS parsing mechanisms
- Browser rendering pipeline

**System Design Challenge:**
Design a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Editor in real-time on whiteboard

**Key Considerations Discussed:**

- Content editable div vs textarea approach
- Rich text editing capabilities
- State management for editor content
- Toolbar functionality and commands
- Undo/redo implementation
- Saving and loading documents
- Performance optimization for large documents
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Outcome:** Extremely challenging but completed all discussions. This round was exhausting and lasted 2 hours.

### Round 4: Managerial Round

A more conversational and behavioral round with a smooth interviewer who listened carefully.

**Topics Discussed:**

**Technical Leadership:**

- Single Page Applications (SPA) architecture
- Performance optimization strategies
- Web application optimization techniques
- Testing strategies and best practices

**Behavioral Questions:**

- Conflict resolution experiences
- Team collaboration examples
- Handling disagreements with teammates
- Project challenges and how they were overcome

**Scenario-Based Questions:**

- "What would you do if your site goes down in production?"
- Handling production incidents
- Debugging strategies under pressure
- Communication during critical situations

**Outcome:** Good conversation, demonstrated both technical knowledge and soft skills

## Key Takeaways

1. **Practice consistently** - I had seen the OA question the day before but skipped it. Don't skip problems!

2. **Master graph algorithms** - Union Find and BFS/DFS came up multiple times

3. **Frontend depth matters** - Beyond React/Angular, know browser internals, rendering pipeline, and performance optimization

4. **System design preparation** - Be ready to design real-world applications like editors, with whiteboard discussions

5. **Stamina is key** - Round 3 lasted 2 hours and was mentally exhausting. Stay focused!

6. **Balance breadth and depth** - You need both algorithmic skills and deep frontend knowledge

---

## Preparation Tips

- **For OA:** Practice graph problems, especially Union Find and component-based questions
- **For DSA Round:** Focus on medium-hard LeetCode problems, be able to explain your approach clearly
- **For Frontend Round:** Study browser internals, not just frameworks. Understand CRP, parsing, and rendering
- **For System Design:** Practice designing real applications with scalability and performance in mind
- **For Managerial Round:** Prepare STAR format examples of past experiences and challenging scenarios

**Overall Experience:** Challenging but fair. Salesforce tests both your coding skills and deep understanding of web technologies. The multi-round format on the same day was intense but efficient.

## Final Verdict

> **⚠️ VERDICT: GHOSTED**
>
> Despite completing all four rounds on the same day and performing well in most rounds, I never received any feedback or follow-up from Salesforce. No rejection email, no offer, no communication whatsoever. This is unfortunately a common experience with many companies, but it's disappointing after investing an entire day in their interview process.

_Good luck to everyone interviewing! Stay consistent with your preparation and remember that ghosting is a reflection of the company's recruitment process, not your performance._
